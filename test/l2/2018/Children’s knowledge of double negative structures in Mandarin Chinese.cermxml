        <p>This study investigated children's knowledge of double negation in Mandarin Chinese. Double negation is a phenomenon where two negatives cancel each other out, thereby yielding a positive meaning. Previous research found that children did not have knowledge of double negation until the age of seven or later. We argue that the observed difficulty of children in previous research is due to an artifact of the experimental task where the target structure was presented without the support of an appropriate context. To see whether preschool children have knowledge of double negation, we used experimental tasks which presented the structure in a plausible context. The results show that 5-year-olds already know that two negatives cancel each other out. By age 6 children are even able to produce double negation in an adult-like manner. This is evidence that double negation does not pose significant difficulty for young children if a plausible context is provided.</p>

      <title>1 Introduction</title>
      <p>
        In logic, negation is a simple notion. Adding negation to a formula reverses its truth
value (e.g., if a statement p is true, then not-p is false, and vice versa). There is only
one negation operator in logic, and it can be applied iteratively. In logic, therefore,
two negatives cancel each other out (e.g., not-not-p is equivalent to p). In contrast,
negation in natural language is a complex phenomenon. Its effects go well beyond a
simple change in truth value. Consider English. Negation can be marked by words
like not (e.g., He did not go to the party), no (e.g., I have no doubt), and never (e.g.,
She never loved me), and by prefixes such as un- (e.g., unhappy), in- (e.g., inactive)
and dis- (e.g., dishonest). Negation also interacts with quantifiers. For example,
English speakers interpret the sentence All vegetarians do not eat meat as having the
meaning that no vegetarian eats meat, yet the same speaker would interpret the
sentence All planes do not carry pets as meaning that some, but not all planes, carry
pets
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">(e.g., Hintikka 2002)</xref>
        . This difference in interpretation is often referred to as a
‘scope phenomenon.’ In the first example, the ‘none’ meaning arises because the
universal quantifier all takes scope over the negation marker not (all [ not). In the
second example, the ‘not all’ meaning arises, because the negation marker not takes
scope over the universal quantifier all (not [ all). In addition, when two negatives
occur in the same sentence, there is a subtle change in meaning between the double
negative structure in (2) and its affirmative counterpart in (1). Although the two
negatives in (2) cancel each other out, they produce a weakened affirmative, as
compared to (1)
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">(Horn 1989)</xref>
        . To further complicate matters, in some languages like
French and Italian, two negatives do not cancel each other out. For instance, in the
Italian example (3), instead of cancelling each other out the two negatives equal a
single semantic negation. So, (3) means that Gianni didn’t eat anything. This
phenomenon is referred to as Negative Concord
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">(see Zeijlstra 2004 for a detailed
discussion)</xref>
        .
(1) It was possible that John failed the exam.
(2) It was not impossible that John failed the exam.
(3) Gianni non ha mangiato niente
      </p>
      <p>Gianni not has eaten nothing
‘Gianni didn’t eat anything.’
(4) I didn’t drive to work today.</p>
      <p>
        In natural language the use of negation is always subject to pragmatic constraints.
Negative statements are generally used to point out discrepancies between a
presumed expectation and the facts
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10 ref13 ref28 ref29 ref8 ref9">(Givo´n 1978, 1993; Glenberg et al. 1999; Horn
1989; Wason 1965, 1971)</xref>
        . For example, when hearing the negative sentence in (4),
the listener would assume that the speaker normally drives to work. The sentence
would sound awkward if it were uttered by someone who the listeners know
normally commutes by train. We will refer to the pragmatic constraints as the
felicity conditions on the use of negation. In natural language, the felicity conditions
play a crucial role in the use of negative sentences, as we discuss below.
      </p>
      <p>The asymmetry between negation in logic and in natural language has been an
important area of inquiry in both linguistics and psychology, since it provides
insights into the relationship between logic and language. In particular, research has
focused on children’s knowledge of negation, since it is there that light is shed on
the development of our logical abilities. However, our current understanding of
children’s knowledge of negation comes mainly from studies using a single
negation. Few studies have looked at children’s knowledge of double negation. The
present study investigates children’s comprehension and production of double
negation in Mandarin Chinese. The purpose of the study is twofold: first, to
determine the age at which children have mastered the law of double negation in
logic, according to which two negatives yield a positive meaning and, second, to
determine the age at which children first correctly apply negative markers iteratively
to produce double negative structures. The paper is structured as follows. First we
discuss the role of felicity conditions in processing negative sentences. Then we
introduce the double negation phenomenon in Mandarin Chinese and review
previous research on children’s understanding of double negation. We argue that
children’s difficulty in processing double negative sentences, found in previous
research, is minimized or eliminated altogether by providing appropriate contexts.
Finally, we present two experiments investigating Mandarin-speaking children’s
comprehension and production of double negative sentences.</p>

      <title>2 The felicity conditions on the use of negation</title>
      <p>
        Negative sentences are generally presumed to be harder to process than their
affirmative counterparts, resulting in longer response times and higher error rates
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2 ref24 ref27">(e.g., Carpenter et al. 1999; Sherman 1976; Wason 1959)</xref>
        . However, research has
also shown that for both adults and children negation does not pose significant
processing demands when the felicity conditions associated with it are satisfied
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10 ref17 ref17 ref18 ref21 ref21 ref25 ref28 ref29 ref31 ref5">(e.g., de Villiers and Tager Flusberg 1975; Glenberg et al. 1999; Kaup et al. 2006,
2007; Lu¨dtke and Kaup 2006; Staab 2007; Wason 1965, 1971)</xref>
        . A number of
experimental studies have found that the processing difficulty associated with
negation can be alleviated or even eliminated if the experimental situation allows
for the appropriate use of negative sentences.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example,
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">Wason (1971)</xref>
        found that a negative sentence like (5) was more
difficult for adults to process than a positive sentence like (6) even though (5) and
(6) express the same proposition. However, the difficulty associated with negation
was considerably mitigated when sentence (5) was preceded by a positive statement
like 4 is an even number, as indicated in (7).
(5) 5 is not an even number.
(6) 5 is an odd number.
(7) a. 4 is an even number, but 5 is not an even number.
      </p>
      <p>b. 4 is an even number, and 5 is not an even number.</p>
      <p>
        Similar findings were presented in
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">Glenberg et al. (1999)</xref>
        . These researchers
conducted a series of experiments investigating adults’ processing of negative
sentences, and they found that negative sentences were processed as fast as their
positive counterparts when presented in appropriate contexts. For example, in one of
their experiments, participants were asked to read both positive (e.g., (9a)) and
negative sentences (e.g., (9b)) following either supportive contexts (e.g., context
(8a) established an expectation that the couch might be black), or non-supportive
contexts (e.g., context (8b) didn’t establish the expectation that the couch might be
black). Participants’ reading times were then recorded.
(8) a. She wasn’t sure if a darkly colored couch would look the best or a lighter
color.
      </p>
      <p>She finally picked one out and had it delivered to her home.
b. She wasn’t sure what kind of material she wanted the couch to be made of.</p>
      <p>She finally picked one out and had it delivered to her home.
(9) a. The couch was black.</p>
      <p>b. The couch wasn’t black.</p>
      <p>The results showed that negative sentences like (9b) were read as fast as positive
sentences like (9a) when the negative sentences were preceded by supportive
contexts (e.g., (8a)). On the basis of these findings, Glenberg and colleagues
concluded that negative sentences are not necessarily harder to process than positive
sentences if they are used in an appropriate context, and the processing difficulty
associated with negation found in some previous studies might be due to an
experimental artifact that negative sentences were presented outside of an
appropriate context.</p>
      <p>
        The importance of an appropriate context in the use of negation has also been
confirmed in children’s comprehension of negative sentences
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11 ref5">(e.g., de Villiers and
Tager Flusberg 1975; Gualmini 2004)</xref>
        . For example, de Villiers and Tager Flusberg
(1975) investigated two- to five-year-old English-speaking children’s interpretation
of negative sentences using a sentence completion task. In the task, seven or eight
objects (or drawings) were placed in front of a child. Among these objects (or
drawings), six or seven were similar and one was different (e.g., seven cars and one
baby’s bottle). The experimenter then pointed to one of the objects and asked ‘‘This
is a __?’’ or ‘‘This is not a __?’’, thus eliciting true affirmatives or true negatives. In
this task, answering a negative probe for the exceptional item (e.g., the baby’s
bottle) is more plausible than answering a negative probe for one of the similar
items (e.g., one of the seven cars). Therefore, children were expected to respond to
negative sentences like ‘‘This is not a __?’’ faster and more accurately when the
experimenter pointed to the exceptional item than when the experimenter pointed to
one of the similar items. This hypothesis was confirmed in the study. It was found
that only the implausible negative sentences were associated with longer response
times and higher error rates. If the negative sentences were presented in a plausible
context (i.e., when the experimenter pointed to the exceptional item), four-year-old
English-speaking children showed no differences in the interpretation of the
affirmative sentences and the corresponding negative sentences. Based on the
findings, de Villiers and Tager Flusberg concluded that negation does not pose
significant processing demands for children if appropriate contexts are provided. By
4 years of age, plausible negatives are no more difficult than affirmatives.
      </p>
      <p>
        Taken together, previous research suggests that the difficulty of processing
negative sentences can be mitigated if appropriate contexts are provided to satisfy
the felicity conditions associated with negation. The nature of the processing
difficulty associated with negation, as
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">Horn (1989)</xref>
        argued, is not a property of
negation per se, but rather reflects a consequence of the way negative sentences are
used in natural language. For the purpose of the present study, we propose that the
same argument applies to children’s interpretation of double negation. More
specifically, we want to argue that the difficulty associated with double negation,
observed in previous studies, can be greatly minimized by providing an appropriate
context. We present two experiments investigating how Mandarin-speaking children
comprehend and produce double negative sentences. Before reporting the
experiments, we will briefly introduce double negative structures in Mandarin Chinese,
and review previous studies on children’s interpretation of double negative
sentences.
      </p>

      <title>3 Double negative structures in Mandarin Chinese</title>
      <p>
        Mandarin Chinese is a typical double negative language
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20 ref3 ref6">(Cheng and Li 1991; Ding
1961; Lu¨ 1985)</xref>
        . There are two primary negation markers in Mandarin Chinese: bu
and mei(you)1 (both are translated as English not). The two negation markers can be
combined iteratively to form a double negative structure. The following examples
illustrate.
(10) Ta bu hui bu
he not will not
‘He won’t not come.’
lai.
      </p>
      <p>come
(11) Mei(you)-ren mei lai.</p>
      <p>not(have)-person not come
‘Nobody did not come.’2
(12) Wo mei(you) bu xihuan xiandai yinyue.</p>
      <p>I not(have) not like modern music
‘It is not the case that I don’t like modern music.</p>
      <p>(bu ? bu)
(mei ? mei)
(mei ? bu)
In all the three examples, the two negatives cancel each other out, thereby yielding
a positive meaning. So sentence (10) means he will come, sentence (11) means
everybody came, and sentence (12) means I like modern music.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-4">
      <title>4 Double negation in child language</title>
      <p>
        Previous research on children’s understanding of negative sentences mainly focused
on children’s knowledge of single negation
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11 ref19 ref22 ref31 ref32 ref5 ref7">(e.g., de Villiers and Tager Flusberg
1975; Fan 2007; Gualmini 2004; Lee and Fan 2009; Pea 1980; Zhang et al. 2006;
Zhou 2002)</xref>
        . Most of these studies have found that two- to three-year-old children
already know that negation reverses the truth value of a statement, and they use
negation to deny statements. Studies on Mandarin-speaking children’s acquisition of
negation have shown that Mandarin-speaking children have mastered the basic

throughout the text mei and mei(you) refer to the same negation marker.

corresponding structure, as in (11), is perfectly natural in Mandarin Chinese.

        .
      </p>
      <p>
        However, only a few studies have looked at children’s knowledge of double
negation. Three studies, as far as we know, have directly investigated children’s
understanding of double negative sentences, and the conclusion seems to be that
preschool children do not have the concept of double negation, but rather they
interpret double negation as single negation
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15 ref16 ref33">(Jou 1988; Jouie 1995; Zhu 1986)</xref>

        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">Jou
(1988)</xref>
        investigated Taiwan Mandarin-speaking children’s comprehension of double
negation, using an act-out task. In the task, children were asked to carry out actions
with dolls according to the test sentences containing double negation. Eleven age
groups of children, ranging in age from 4 to 14 years, participated in this
experiment. On a typical trial children heard a sentence as in (13), and were then
asked to carry out the action using the dolls provided in the experimental
workspace. It was found that children younger than 7 years of age consistently acted
out the double negative sentences in a similar way as they did with the
corresponding single negative sentences, rather than the corresponding positive
sentences. For example, instead of acting out a positive meaning as in (14), children
younger than 7 consistently acted out the double negative sentence in (13) as having
a negative meaning in (15). Children aged between 7 and 13 acted out the double
negative sentences either as having a positive meaning or having a negative
meaning. Only the 14-year-olds consistently acted out the double negative sentences
as having a meaning equivalent to the corresponding positive sentences.

On the basis of these findings, Jou concluded that children go through a stage where
they analyze double negation as single negation before they acquire the law of
double negation. Preschool children don’t have the concept of double negation. Jou
attributed the late acquisition of double negation to the difficulty associated with
processing negative information. The finding that preschool children have difficulty
with double negation has also been reported in
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">Zhu (1986)</xref>
        and has been replicated
for Cantonese-speaking children by
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">Jouie (1995)</xref>
        . Like in Jou’s study,
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">Zhu (1986)</xref>
        used an act-out task in which children were asked to act out the double negative
sentences produced by the experimenter, using the toy props, and she found that
Mandarin-speaking children younger than 7 had difficulty processing double
negative structures. Using a similar task,
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">Jouie (1995)</xref>
        found that only 10-year-old
Cantonese-speaking children consistently interpreted a double negative structure as
having a positive meaning.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, we want to argue that preschool children’s difficulty with double
negation, observed in these previous studies, might not be due to their lack of
concept of double negation, but rather due to the nature of the experimental task.
These previous studies used act-out tasks. There are limitations of using an act-out
task. In the task, the experimenter presents a sentence to the child participant and
instructs the child to act out the sentence using toys and props that are present in the
experimental workspace. We will argue that the results of this task can seriously
undermine children’s knowledge of double negation.3 A major drawback of using
an act-out task is that it presents the test sentences outside of a context. We suspect
that younger children’s failure in processing a double negative structure in previous
studies might be due to this design feature. For example, in Jou’s (1988) study,
children were asked to act out a double negative sentence like (13) with no contexts
provided. As we discussed, an appropriate context is crucial for children’s
interpretation of negative sentences. So it is not surprising that the younger children
in Jou’s study failed to process double negative structures when the sentences were
presented outside of a context. In addition, it should also be noticed that the double
negative structures used in Jou’s study were quite complex. Consider sentence (13)
Hong wawa meiyou bu ba lü wawa tuidao ‘It is not the case that the red doll doesn’t
strike down the green doll.’ The two negation markers in (13) are in separate
clauses. Processing such a complex sentence without any supporting contexts would
have already been difficult for the younger children. To act it out would have been
even harder. To recap, we argue that the observed difficulty experienced by
preschool children in processing a double negative structure might be due to the
nature of the experimental task used in previous studies. We expect that this
processing difficulty associated with double negation would be minimized if an
appropriate context were provided. So to investigate the possibility that the
experimental infelicities, and not the lack of the concept of double negation, were
responsible for younger children’s difficulties in processing a double negative
structure, we used experimental tasks which presented the double negative structure
in a plausible context, and instead of using a double negative structure as in (13), we
used a simpler double negative structure as in (11): Mei-you-ren mei lai ‘Nobody
did not come’ where the two negative markers are in the same clause. More
specifically, two experiments were conducted to test children’s knowledge of double
negation. Experiment 1 used a truth value judgment task
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">(Crain and Thornton 1998)</xref>
        to investigate the age at which children have mastered the law of double negation,
whereby two negatives cancel each other out, thus yielding a positive meaning.
Experiment 2 used an elicited production task to determine the age at which
children correctly produce double negative structures.
3 It should be understood that we are not condemning all studies using an act-out task. The task is not
inherently defective and there are places where it could be put to good use.

watched the stories alongside the child participant. At the end of the story, the
puppet attempted to explain to the child participant what it thought had happened in
the story using a test sentence. The child’s task was to judge whether or not the
puppet had said the right thing about the story. If the child informed the puppet that
he was wrong, then he was asked to explain: ‘‘what really happened?’’ The child
participants were introduced to the task individually and then tested individually.
They were given four practice trials before the actual test, two in which the puppet’s
statements were true descriptions of the corresponding stories, and two in which the
puppet’s statements were false descriptions of the corresponding stories, so that
children knew that the puppet could say something wrong. These practice trials
were also used to familiarize children with the task. Only those children who
correctly accepted the true statements and rejected the false statements were
included in the actual test.
5.3 Materials and design
Six test trials were constructed. On three of the trials, the double negative structure
was a true description of the corresponding story (hereafter ‘true’ scenario), and on
the other three the double negative structure was a false description of the
corresponding story (hereafter ‘false’ scenario). Two examples are used to illustrate.
        </p>
        <p>In a typical ‘true’ scenario, the experimenter acted out the story depicted in
Fig. 1. In the story, the little hippo invited his friends, Garfield, the little bunny and
Winnie the Pooh, to his birthday party. The day before the little hippo’s birthday
Garfield and the little bunny already had their gifts ready, but Winnie the Pooh was
having a toothache. So he hadn’t had a chance to prepare the gift. The next day
4 The division of the child participants into the two age groups was done post-hoc, based on the
performance of each individual participant. The findings of the first experiment show that there was a
clear distinction between the response patterns of the children younger than 5;6 and those aged 5;6 and
above.
Garfield and the little bunny went to the party with their gifts, and they told the little
hippo that Winnie the Pooh might not come because he was having a toothache. But
when the party was about to begin, Winnie the Pooh showed up with a birthday gift.
He had made it to the party after all. After the story, the puppet described what
happened in the story, using the test sentence in (16). The child was then asked to
judge whether or not the puppet had said the right thing about the story.

birthday</p>
        <p>Note that in order to use a double negative structure felicitously, the expectation/
presupposition associated with the structure must be established in the context. For
example, the expectation/presupposition associated with a double negative structure
like (16) is that not everybody was expected to go to the party, or somebody might
not go to the party. So to satisfy this felicity condition associated with the structure,
an expectation about the main characters’ actions was explicitly established at the
beginning of the story. This was achieved by making clear the possibility that
Winnie the Pooh might not go to the party because he was having a toothache and
he hadn’t got the gift ready. However, when the story concluded it turned out that
everybody made it to the party including Winnie the Pooh, and thereby the
expectation established at the beginning wasn’t fulfilled.</p>
        <p>In a typical ‘false’ scenario, the experimenter acted out the story depicted in
Fig. 2.</p>
        <p>In the story, three friends, the little turtle, the little elephant and the little donkey,
went to look for their moms. The mommy elephant and the mommy turtle were in
the forest, but the mommy donkey wasn’t there. The little elephant went to the
forest and found his mom. So did the little turtle. The little donkey asked the zebra if
she was his mom, but unfortunately the zebra told the little donkey that she was not.
Fig. 2 Looking for moms
So the little donkey didn’t find his mom. Following the story, the puppet produced
the test sentence in (17). The child was then asked to judge whether or not the
puppet had said the right thing about the story.
(17) Mei-you-ren mei zhaodao mama.</p>
        <p>not-have-person not find mother
‘Nobody did not find his mother.’
(Meaning: Everybody found his mother.)</p>
        <p>Again, in order to establish the expectation/presupposition associated with the
double negative structure in (17) (i.e., somebody might not be able to find his
mother), at the beginning of the story it was made clear to the child that the mommy
elephant and the mommy turtle were in the forest, but the mommy donkey wasn’t.
So, the little donkey might not be able to find his mother. In the end, the little
elephant and the little turtle found their mom, but the little donkey didn’t, and thus
the expectation established at the beginning was fulfilled.</p>
        <p>In addition, four control trials were included to verify that children could
understand positive and single negative sentences. The stories used on the control
trials were similar to those on the test trials. On two of the control trials, the puppet
produced a positive structure like (18). On the other two control trials, the puppet
produced a single negative structure like (19). Two of the control sentences were
true descriptions of the corresponding stories and two were false descriptions of the
corresponding stories. The test and control trials were presented in a pseudo-random
order. All the test sentences are provided in Appendix 1.

        <title>5.4 Predictions</title>
        <p>If children have knowledge of double negation, then they would be expected to
accept the double negative structures in the ‘true’ scenarios, and reject them in the
‘false’ scenarios. For example, in the example ‘true’ scenario children would be
expected to accept sentence (16), because the sentence means everybody went to the
birthday party, which was a true description of the corresponding story. In the
example ‘false’ scenario, children should reject sentence (17), and should justify
this response by pointing out that the little donkey didn’t find his mother, because
the sentence means everybody found his mother. If, on the other hand, children do
not have the concept of double negation and thus interpret double negation as single
negation as observed in previous research, then they would be expected to reject the
double negative structures in both ‘true’ and ‘false’ scenarios. In the example ‘true’
scenario, children would reject sentence (16) by pointing out that everybody went to
the birthday party, since they would interpret sentence (16) as equivalent to a single
negative structure like nobody went to the birthday party. Similarly, in the example
‘false’ scenario, children would be expected to reject sentence (17) by making
reference to the fact that the little elephant and the little turtle found their mothers,
because they would interpret sentence (17) to mean nobody found his mother.
5.5 Results and discussion
All the children responded correctly to the control trials 100% of the time. So, their
data were all included in the final analysis. The dependent measure was the
proportion of correct responses in the two types of scenarios. Figure 3 shows the
proportion of correct responses in the two types of scenarios by the two age groups.
The division of the child participants into the two age groups was done post-hoc,
based on the performance of each individual participant. The proportion of correct
responses for each participant is provided in Appendix 2. The findings showed that
children aged 5;6 and above consistently gave correct responses, whereas children
younger than 5;6 consistently gave incorrect responses. On the basis of these
findings, we decided to divide the child participants into two age groups: 4;2–5;5
and 5;6–5;10. A detailed analysis of the data is given as follows.</p>
        <p>As indicated in Fig. 3, the older group gave more correct responses than the
younger group in both conditions. In the ‘true’ scenarios, children aged between
5;6–5;10 accepted the double negative structures 86.67% of the time, whereas
children aged between 4;2–5;5 did so only 20% of the time. The other 80% of
the time they consistently rejected the true test sentences by pointing out that all
the characters under consideration did something. For example, in the scenario
where Garfield, the little bunny and Winnie the Pooh all went to the birthday
party, they rejected the double negative structure in (16), repeated here as (20).
When asked to justify their rejections, they all pointed out that the characters all
went to the birthday party. A representative justification from a child aged 4;7 is
given in (21).

In the ‘false’ scenarios, children aged between 5;6–5;10 correctly rejected the test
sentences 86.67% of the time, whereas children aged between 4;2–5;5 did so only
20% of the time. The other 80% of the time they rejected the test sentences for
wrong reasons. For example, in the scenario where the little elephant and the little
turtle found their moms, but the little donkey didn’t, the older group consistently
rejected the double negative structure in (17), repeated here as (22), either by
pointing out that the little donkey didn’t find his mother or by saying that only two
guys found their mothers. A representative justification from a child aged 5;8 is
given in (23). The younger group also rejected the sentence but for a different
reason. When asked for reasons for rejection, the younger group consistently
referred to the fact that someone found their mothers either by saying the sentence
youren zhaodao le ‘someone found their mothers’, or by pointing to the fact that the
little elephant and the little turtle found their mothers. A representative justification
from a child aged 4;5 is given in (24).

(Pointing to the little elephant and the little turtle)
The performance of each individual participant was consistent across the trials. In
the ‘true’ scenarios, the participant either accepted all the three test sentences or
rejected them all. In the ‘false’ scenarios, the participant gave similar reasons for
their rejections of the three test sentences.</p>
        <p>
          To assess the difference between the two groups statistically, generalized linear
mixed models (GLMMs) were applied using the R software package (i.e., lme4),
version 2.15.0
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">(R Development Core Team 2012)</xref>
          . This analysis corresponds to a
logistic regression, taking into account the variability that occurred across
participants and across items
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">(Baayen et al. 2008)</xref>
          . We fit the data from the two
conditions separately (i.e., a model for children’s responses in the ‘true’ scenarios
and a model for their responses in the ‘false’ scenarios). The models treated age
(i.e., two age groups) as fixed effects, with random intercepts and slopes for items
(Formula in R: response * group ? (1|item) ? (1 ? group|item)).
        </p>
        <p>The models revealed that age was a reliable predictor for children’s responses in
both conditions. In both ‘true’ and ‘false’ scenarios, there was a higher proportion of
correct responses in the older group than in the younger group (b = 3.26,
SE = 0.41, z = 8.01, p \ .001). The difference between the two age groups, as
shown in Fig. 3, was supported by the statistical modelling.</p>
        <p>The results of this experiment show that children aged between 5;6–5;10
interpreted a double negative structure as equivalent to a positive meaning, but
children aged between 4;2–5;5 interpreted the same structure as equivalent to a
single negative structure. The findings indicate that children have knowledge of
double negation by age 5;6. This is evidence that preschool children have the
concept of double negation whereby two negatives cancel each other out, and thus
are logically equivalent to a positive meaning. But they pass through a stage where
double negation is analyzed as single negation. A further question to ask was then
whether preschool children can apply negative markers iteratively to correctly
produce a double negative structure, once they have knowledge of double negation.
So a second experiment was designed to investigate whether children aged 5;6 and
above can correctly produce a double negative structure in an appropriate context.</p>

      <title>6 Experiment 2</title>
      <p>6.1 Participants
Twenty six monolingual Mandarin-speaking children participated in this experiment.
They were divided into two age groups: 13 children were between 5;6 to 5;11 (8 boys
and 5 girls) and 13 children were between 6;0 to 6;5 (5 boys and 8 girls). All the child
participants were recruited from the kindergarten at Beijing Language and Culture
University. They had no reported history of speech, hearing or language disorders.
None of them had participated in Experiment 1. In order to see whether
Mandarinspeaking adults use double negative structures in the same contexts, 15
Mandarinspeaking adults (age range 23 to 26, 7 women and 8 men) were tested as controls. The
adult participants were students at Beijing Language and Culture University.
6.2 Procedure
Both children and adults were tested using an elicited production task. Like the truth
value judgment task, it involved two experimenters. One experimenter acted out
stories with toy props to create contexts for a felicitous use of double negation. The
other experimenter played the role of a puppet who watched the stories alongside
the participant. The experimental session proceeded as follows. The first
experimenter introduced the puppet to the participant and told the participant that the
puppet was very forgetful and often forgets what happened in the story. So when the
story concluded, the puppet would ask the participant a question, and the
participant’s task was to help the puppet answer the question, so that the puppet
could better understand the story. The puppet’s question after each story is a guise
for an elicitation technique that allows the experimenter to probe the participant’s
knowledge of the double negative structure. The participants were introduced to the
task individually and then tested individually. They were given two practice trials
before the actual test. On the two trials, the puppet asked a simple question about the
corresponding story. These practice trials were used to familiarize the participants
with the task. Only those participants who provided correct answers to the questions
were included in the actual test.
6.3 Materials and design
The experimental session consisted of ten trials: six test trials and four control trials.
On the test trials, the stories were similar to the ‘true’ scenarios in Experiment 1
where all the three characters under consideration successfully did something. On
the control trials, the stories were similar to the ‘false’ scenarios in Experiment 1 in
which two of the characters successfully did something, but one failed. The
questions used on the test and control trials share the same structure. Again, we used
the two example stories in Experiment 1 to illustrate.</p>
      <p>On a typical test trial, the experimenter acted out the story where the little hippo
invited his friends, Garfield, the little bunny and Winnie the Pooh, to his birthday
party. In the end, the little bunny, Winnie the Pooh and Garfield all went to the
party. After the story, the puppet asked a question as in (25b) preceded by a lead-in
sentence like (25a). The participant was then prompted to answer the question. The
questions posed by the puppet on the test trials are critical for the elicitation of
double negative structures.

moms. In the end, the little elephant and the little turtle found their moms, but the
little donkey didn’t. Following the story, the puppet produced the question in (26b)
preceded by a lead-in sentence like (26a). Again, the participant was prompted to
answer the question. The control trials were used to see whether children could
understand the question structure used in the experiment. The questions used in the
experiment are provided in Appendix 3.

        <p>If children can correctly produce a double negative structure by applying two
negative markers iteratively, then they would be expected to produce a structure like
(27) in response to questions like (25b).
All experimental sessions were audio-recorded, and then transcribed by the
experimenter. To assess the transcription reliability, the responses from six children
and five adults (out of the 41 participants) were selected to be scored by a second
coder. Overall, interrater reliability was high (.97). Cases in which there was
disagreement were discussed with a third coder and a consensus was reached.
6.6 Results and discussion
All the participants responded correctly to the control trials 100% of the time. So,
their data were all included in the final analysis. We first calculated the number of
productions of double negative structures in response to the puppet’s questions by
each participant (see Appendix 4 for the data of each child participant). Then for
each participant we computed the proportion of the productions of double negative
structures out of the six total test trials. Figure 4 summarizes the proportion of
double negative structures produced by the three age groups.</p>
        <p>As Fig. 4 illustrates, the 6-year-olds exhibited adult-like performance, but not the
5-year-olds. In response to the test questions, the adults produced double negative
structures 80% of the time, and the 6-year-olds did so 76.92% of the time. For
example, when the puppet asked the question in (25b) after the story in which all the
three friends went to the birthday party, children aged between 6;0 and 6;5 provided
an answer either using the double negative structure in (28a) or the one in (28b).

b. Mei-you-ren mei qu.</p>
        <p>not-have-person not go
‘Nobody did not go.’
The 5-year-olds, however, did not provide any double negative structures. Instead,
they either used the corresponding positive structures (19% of the time), or simply
used a simple negative structure (81% of the time). For example, when presented
with the same question in (25b), they either produced the positive structure in (29a),
or the single negative structure in (29b).

Although the 5-year-olds did not use a double negative structure, the two structures
in (29a) and (29b) are also legitimate answers to a Mandarin question like (25b),
repeated here as (30). Actually some of the adults (20% of the time) and the
sixyear-olds (23.08% of the time) also provided structures like (29a) and (29b). The
five-year-olds simply tended to avoid using a double negative structure.
(30) Ni neng gaosu wo you-shei mei qu ma?
you can tell me have-who not go Q
‘I wonder if there is anyone who did not go.’</p>
        <p>Again, GLMMs were applied to assess this difference between the three age
groups, using the lme4 package. The models treated age (i.e., three age groups) as
fixed effects, with random intercepts and slopes for items (Formula in R:
response * group ? (1|item) ? (1 ? group|item)). The models revealed that age
was a reliable predictor of the proportion of double negative structures in the
participants’ productions. There was a lower proportion of double negative
structures in the 5-year-olds than in the 6-year-olds (b = 1.20, SE = 0.27,
z = 4.48, p \ .001) and the adults (b = 1.39, SE = 0.26, z = 5.26, p \ .001).
Post-hoc comparisons showed that there was no difference between the 6-year-olds
and the adults in the proportion of double negative structures (b = 0.18, SE = 0.38,
z = 0.48, p[.05).</p>
        <p>The results of this experiment show that the 6-year-olds correctly produced a
double negative structure when provided with an appropriate context, and they
produced the structure to the same extent as the adults did. These findings suggest
that by age 6 children can apply negative markers iteratively to correctly produce a
double negative structure. The 5-year-olds, however, tended to avoid using a double
negative structure to answer the questions, even though they could correctly
understand the questions. We will return to this point in the general discussion.</p>

      <title>7 General discussion</title>
      <p>
        The present study investigated the age at which children have mastered the law of
double negation, whereby two negatives cancel each other out, and thus are
logically equivalent to a positive. Previous research on children’s interpretation of
double negative sentences reached the conclusion that preschool children did not
have the concept of double negation
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">(e.g., Jou 1988)</xref>
        . However, we argued that
children’s failure in processing double negative structures in previous studies was
likely due to an artifact of the experimental task. In previous research, children were
tested using an act-out task in which they were asked to act out the double negative
sentences using the toys that were available in the experimental workspace. This
task is problematic, however, since it lacks the kind of supporting contexts that is
needed to satisfy the felicity conditions associated with a double negative structure.
As we discussed, this design feature may have seriously impeded children’s ability
to successfully demonstrate their knowledge of double negation. As has been shown
previously in the literature on child language, a felicitous context is critical for
evoking children’s adult-like knowledge of negative sentences. When a felicitous
context is supplied, negation has not posed serious difficulties for preschool
children.
      </p>
      <p>
        We applied the same research strategy to children’s interpretation of double
negative structures. Specifically, we argued that the observed difficulties
experienced by young children in the processing of double negative structures might be
greatly diminished if the double negative structure was presented in a felicitous
context. To test this hypothesis, a truth value judgment task was conducted in which
children were asked to judge whether or not a double negative structure was a true
description of a given story acted out by the experimenter. A crucial design feature
of this task is that the test sentences were presented in a context that satisfied the
felicity conditions associated with the use of double negative structures. The
findings revealed that, by age 5;6, children successfully interpreted a double
negative structure in the same way as adult language users. However, the reviewers
pointed out that stronger evidence for preschool children’s knowledge of double
negation should come from studies using the double negative structures as those
used in
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">Jou (1988)</xref>
        . The logic is that if preschool children are also able to assign a
positive meaning to the double negative structures as those used in
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">Jou (1988)</xref>
        , then
this would constitute direct evidence that children’s difficulty with double negation
observed in previous research is due to a lack of an appropriate context in the
experimental tasks. We wish to note that we actually did an experiment in which a
double negative structure like (31) was used. Similar to the structure used in
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">Jou
(1988)</xref>
        (see (13), repeated here as (32)), the two negation markers in (31) are in
separate clauses.

Using a truth value judgment task as in the present study, we tested 16
Mandarinspeaking children aged between 5;6 and 5;9. A double negative structure like (31)
was presented in either a context where it was a true description of the
corresponding story, or in a context in which it was a false description of the
corresponding story. We found that the children correctly interpreted a double
negative structure like (31) 88% of the time, assigning a positive meaning to the
structure.</p>
      <p>
        Taken together, our findings are strong evidence that preschool children
successfully convert double negation into a positive meaning if they are given
appropriate contextual support. The findings also indicate that children have
mastered the law of double negation by age 5;6. By age 5;6 Mandarin-speaking
children have adult-like ability of logical reasoning involving double negation.
However, children younger than 5;6 interpreted a double negative structure as
equivalent to a single negative structure. This finding invites the conclusion that
children pass through a stage where double negation is analyzed as a single
negation. At this point, an interesting question to ask is what development underlies
this abrupt change between children younger than 5;6 and those aged between 5;6
and above, i.e., children younger than 5;6 consistently interpreted double negation
as having a meaning equivalent to a single negation, whereas children aged 5;6 and
above consistently interpreted double negation as having a positive meaning. There
are two conceivable explanations for this dramatic change. First, one could
hypothesize that children younger than 5;6 do not have the concept of double
negation, and thus interpret double negation as a single negation, while children
aged 5;6 and above have knowledge of double negation. Abrupt changes in
children’s language development are not unusual. For example, similar abrupt
changes have been reported in children’s acquisition of null subjects
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">(Hyams and
Wexler 1993)</xref>
        and their acquisition of inflection related to negation
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">(Thornton and
Tesan 2007)</xref>
        . We wish to note here that the development of children’s linguistic
knowledge is not necessarily a gradual process; sometimes it can be precipitous.
However, an alternative explanation could be that younger children have the
concept of double negation, yet they have difficulty implementing the law of double
negation, presumably due to their limited computational resources (e.g., limitations
in working memory capacity). For example, younger children may have the
knowledge that two negatives cancel each other out, but in order to implement this
law, they first have to hold in their working memory the meaning of the first
negative, and then apply the second negative to the first negative to yield a positive
meaning. This process might pose difficulty for younger children because of their
limitations in working memory capacity. Further research is required to explore the
two possibilities.6
      </p>
      <p>The first experiment was a comprehension task. Based on the findings of the first
experiment, we know that children aged 5;6 and above already have the concept of
double negation. The second experiment used a production task to see whether
preschool children can correctly produce a double negative structure by applying the
two negative markers iteratively, once they have knowledge of double negation. The
research question posed by the second experiment was whether or not children of
the same age can correctly produce a double negative structure when provided with
contextual support. We also tested adult Mandarin-speakers as controls, to make
sure that the contextual support we constructed was adequate to elicit double
negative structures from adults. In the task, the experimenter acted out stories
designed to create contexts for the felicitous use of double negation. After each
story, the participant was asked to provide an answer to the question posed by the
puppet. The puppet’s question was designed to elicit a double negative structure.
The results show that six-year-old children correctly produced a double negative
structure in response to the test questions. In fact, six-year-old children produced
double negative structures to the same extent as adults did. The five-year-olds
exhibited a different pattern than the six-year-olds and the adults, however. Instead
of producing a double negative structure, these children used alternative structures
to answer the questions. Nevertheless, the alternative structures they used were
legitimate answers to the same questions. This suggests that the five-year-olds avoid
using a double negative structure if alternative structures are available. This
tendency is presumably due to the least-effort processing strategy adopted by the
younger children. The basic idea is that (i) if both a sentence with negation markers
and one without negation markers can be used to express the same meaning, the
sentence without negation markers is preferred; and (ii) if both a short sentence and
a long sentence can be used to express the same meaning, the short sentence which
requires less processing resources is preferred. The examples in (28) and (29),
repeated here as (33) and (34), illustrate this point. The double negative structures in
(33) are longer than the alternative structures in (34). In addition, although (33a),
(33b) and (34a) express the same meaning, (34a) doesn’t involve any negation
markers. So the five-year-olds simply adopted a simple, least-effort strategy of
producing the alternative structures in (34) that convey the same intended meaning.
6 One reviewer pointed out that it seems to be more plausible to attribute the abrupt change between the
two age groups to a change in linguistic knowledge than a change in working memory, or computational
resources in general. We are inclined to agree with the reviewer, but decided to leave open the possibility
in the current paper.
(34) a.</p>
      <p>It is likely that the five-year-olds have knowledge of correctly producing a double
negative structure, but avoided using the structure due to their least-effort
processing strategy. So, it remains to be shown that five-year-old children can
correctly produce double negative structures. However, on the basis of the data it is
safe to say that, by age six, children correctly produce double negative structures by
applying negative markers iteratively. Taken together, the results of these two
experiments demonstrate that children have knowledge of double negation by age
5;6, but they pass through a stage where double negation is analyzed as a single
negation. By age 6 children are even able to produce double negative structures in
an adult-like manner. These findings invite the conclusion that preschool children
have adult-like knowledge of double negation. This conclusion stands in contrast
with previous research, which concluded that children did not understand double
negation until the age of seven or later.</p>

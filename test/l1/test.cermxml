      <abstract>
        <p>This paper argues that Old Japanese (eighth century) had split alignment, with nominative-accusative alignment in main clauses and active alignment in nominalized clauses. The main arguments for active alignment in nominalized clause come from ga-marking of active subjects and the distribution of two verbal prefixes: i-for active predicates and sa- for inactive predicates (cf. Yanagida, In: Hasegawa (ed.) Nihongo no shubun genshoˆ [Main clause phenomena in Japanese], 2007b). We review the treatment of non-accusative alignment and argue that active alignment should be analyzed as as a distinct type. We propose a formal analysis of active alignment in nominalized clauses in Old Japanese. The external argument is assigned inherent case, spelled out as ga, in situ in Spec, v. Object arguments are licensed by several distinct mechanisms, including incorporation (Yanagida, In: Miyamoto (ed.) MIT Working Papers in Linguistics, 2007a) and case assignment by a functional head above vP. The latter accounts for the distinctive O wo S ga V word order of OJ nominalized clauses noted by Yanagida (J. of East Asian Linguistics, 2006). Inability to assign object case is a property of [nominal] v, as proposed by Miyagawa (Structure and case marking in Japanese. Syntax and Semantics, vol. 22, 1989). We discuss the diachronic origins of the OJ active alignment system and point out that it exemplifies a cross-linguistically attested pattern of non-accusative alignment in clauses that originate from nominalizations.</p>

        We argue that while conclusive clauses display nominative-accusative alignment,
nominalized clauses have active alignment. In active languages, also known as
activestative
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26 ref27 ref39">(Klimov 1974, 1977; Mithun 1991)</xref>
        , the sole argument of an intransitive verb
shows two distinct patterns: generally speaking, agentive intransitive subjects pattern
1 This paper follows in general the transcription and glossing conventions for Old Japanese in
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">Frellesvig
and Whitman (2008)</xref>
        ; however we gloss inflectional endings only when crucial for the argument. Our data
is taken from the Man’y oˆshuˆ (My; compiled mid-eighth century), based primarily on Yoshimura’s
electronic text as well as the editions by Nakanishi (1978–1983), Kojima et al. (1995) and Satake et al.
(2002). Examples are cited only when the morpheme crucial for the argument is attested in
phonogrammatic form (transcribed in italics); material attested logogrammatically is transcribed in simple text.

with transitive subjects; non-agentive ones pattern with transitive objects. We see
such a pattern in (2). In (2a–b) the external argument, that is, the agent of the transitive
(2a) and unergative (2b) verbs, is marked by the particle ga. In (2c), the patient subject
of the unaccusative verb behaves like the object of the transitive verb in (2a): both are
morphologically bare and occur immediately adjacent to the verb.
      </p>
      <p>Other nominalized clause types include clauses inflected in the realis (izenkei)
(3a), irrealis (mizenkei) conditionals (3b), and nominal clauses in –(a)ku (3c).

(MY 16/ 4011)
Each of the nominalized clause types in (3) share the active alignment properties of
adnominal clauses in (2), beginning with marking of the external argument by ga.</p>
      <p>Transitive nominalized clauses display another important property. As described in
detail by Yanagida (2006), when the direct object is marked with accusative wo, it
precedes the ga-marked external argument in nominalized clauses, as shown in (4):

(MY 19/4166)</p>
      <p>
        We develop an analysis of OJ nominalized clauses that accounts for the
co-occurrence of the active alignment properties in (2) and the [O wo S ga V] object
marking pattern in 4. Nominalized clauses assign inherent case, spelled out as ga, to
the external argument in its base position in Spec, vP. Following a proposal due to
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">Miyagawa (1989)</xref>
        , nominalized verbal projections fail to assign accusative case.
2 The term ‘‘nominal’’ for nominalized clauses in –aku follows Wrona (2008). Wrona shows that –aku
nominal clauses fulfill many of the subordinate clause roles taken on by adnominal clauses in EMJ texts.
For the standard view that the nominal ending is historically derived from the adnominal, see Sect. 6.
Two case licensing strategies are available for direct objects: they may be assigned
case, spelled out as wo, in the specifier of a functional projection above vP, as in (4);
or, if they are non-branching, they may undergo incorporation into the verb
(Yanagida 2005, 2007a,b). The second strategy is also available for patient subjects,
as is wo-marking in a limited context, first pointed out by Vovin (1997) and
described in Sect. 5.
      </p>
      <p>The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews previous analyses. Section 3
outlines the typological properties of active alignment, emphasizing that it has
important differences from the better known ergative pattern. Section 4 shows that
nominalized clauses in OJ share active alignment properties in two specific
domains: case marking of subject arguments and prefixal cross-referencing of the
subject argument on the verb. This section presents a formal analysis of active
alignment in OJ. Section 5 focuses on object marking in nominalized clauses. In
Sect. 6 we discuss the diachronic sources of the OJ alignment pattern in a broader
typological context. Section 7 concludes the paper.</p>

          proposes that in OJ and Early Middle Japanese (EMJ henceforth),
adnominal and conclusive clauses have distinct case assigning mechanisms. The
conclusive form of the verb is truly verbal and assigns abstract case to the object in
underlying object position while the adnominal form has nominal properties and has
no case assigning ability. In adnominal clauses, the object is assigned overt
structural case in the form of wo in order to avoid a violation of the Case Filter.

          propose that Japanese
underwent a change from an abstract to a morphological case marking language and that
the driving force for this change is the increased use of the adnominal in main
clauses. In OJ, nominalized forms including the adnominal are generally restricted
to embedded environments (this is exclusively the case for irrealis conditionals and
the –aku nominalized form); the matrix use of the attributive is predominantly
limited to the kakarimusubi focus construction (see Whitman 1997 and references
cited there). The kakarimusubi construction, however, began to break down in
EMJ
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">(cf. Hendriks 1998)</xref>
          , with the result that adnominal inflection came to be used
in main clauses without a kakari focus particle and eventually replaced the
conclusive in main clauses.

on an extensive survey of EMJ literary texts, argue that the reanalysis of adnominal
as a main clause predicate form led to the increased use of object marking with wo.

          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">Kuroda (2007)</xref>
          proposes that the diachronic difference between modern and earlier
Japanese is accounted for by an Agreement Parameter
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">(cf. Kuroda 1988)</xref>
          : agreement
is forced in earlier Japanese but not in the modern language. In a forced-agreement
language, movement is triggered by agreement-inducing features, and optionality
does not come into play. Kuroda proposes that earlier Japanese was a
forced-agreement language; he claims that wh/focus movement is obligatory, and both subject and
object take obligatory abstract case marking. In modern Japanese, in contrast,
whphrases do not move, relative clause heads need not raise, and abstract case marking is
optional. We will show that the alignment characteristics of OJ are compatible with
the view that certain, but not all, types of movement are forced in OJ nominalized
clauses. In particular, complements marked by wo obligatorily move out of VP.
However, this obligatory movement, together with wh-movement in OJ, is associated
with the domain of active alignment in OJ syntax, namely nominalized clauses. The
characteristic word order flexibility and other types of optionality are allowed in
conclusive clauses, the domain of accusative alignment.

      <title>2.3 Previous non-accusative analyses of Old Japanese</title>
      <p>
        2.3.1 Vovin (1997)
Vovin (1997) suggests that the suffix –i, analyzed as a subject case marker by
traditional grammarians, represents in fact active case, marking subjects of transitive and
of active intransitive verbs but not subjects of non-active intransitive verbs.3 Vovin
further argues that the case marker wo marks absolutive case, in that wo appears not
only with the object of transitive verbs but also with the subject of stative predicates,
in particular predicates suffixed with –mi, called by Vovin ‘‘quality stative verbs.’’
Based on the distribution of -i and wo, Vovin concludes that OJ is a language with
active alignment. Although our analysis of OJ active alignment paper differs in many
respects from his, Vovin deserves primacy of place as the originator of the hypothesis
that OJ syntactic alignment is in important respects non-accusative.
2.3.2 Yanagida (2005, 2007a,b)
Yanagida (2005, 2007a,b) proposes that the historical change described by
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">Miyagawa
(1989)</xref>
        and
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">Miyagawa and Ekida (2003)</xref>
        instantiates the cross-linguistically
welldocumented change from split ergative to accusative. Yanagida’s basic claim is that
Old Japanese is an ergative-active language with a split case system; the split occurs
between main and embedded clauses, a type identified by Dixon (1994, pp. 101–104).
3 Vovin (2005, pp. 111–116) revises this analysis, suggesting that OJ –i may be a loan from Korean. We
return to this point in our discussion of EMJ in Sect. 6.3.
Main predicates in the conclusive (shuˆ shikei) form show accusative alignment.
Predicates in the non-conclusive forms, i.e., irrealis (mizenkei) conditionals,
continuative (renyoˆ kei), adnominal (rentaikei), and realis (izenkei), show
ergativeactive alignment. Yanagida (2007a) proposes that the adnominal form was a vestigial
antipassive and wo was an oblique case marking the demoted object of the antipassive
but was reanalyzed as an accusative case when the antipassive was lost in Old
Japanese.4 A main objective of Yanagida (2007a) is to explain certain apparent
counterexamples to Miyagawa’s (1989) generalization (5). Yanagida (2007b) shows that in
the Man’yoˆ shuˆ , there are 90 tokens of transitive clauses whose subject is marked by
no or ga but whose object is morphologically unmarked. Fifty-five tokens occur with
adnominal predicates, as in (2a), repeated as (6) below.
(6)
佐欲比賣能故何 比列布利斯
Saywopimye no kwo ga pire puri-si
Sayohime Gen child Act scarf wave-PAdn
‘the name of the hill where Sayohime waved her scarf’
      </p>
      <p>
        Examples like this are apparent counter-examples to Miyagawa’s generalization.
However, Yanagida shows that while bare objects do occur with adnominal
predicates, there is a clear pattern to the counter-examples: the bare objects are almost
without exception non-branching N0s. Based on these distributional facts, Yanagida
proposes that bare objects in nominalized clauses like (6) are incorporated, on the
model of languages like Chukchee (Spencer 1999). Chukchee has two types of
derived intransitive constructions: a morphologically marked antipassive and the
object incorporation strategy. Yanagida argues that OJ used object incorporation in
a similar way. Following the basic approach of
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">Baker (1988)</xref>
        , non-branching nouns
immediately adjacent to an adnominal predicate are incorporated into the verb, and
incorporation satisfies the case requirements of the incorporee. This preserves
Miyagawa’s generalization that the object of the adnominal predicate is not assigned
abstract case in its base position.5 Note importantly that object incorporation is a
salient feature of languages with active alignment as observed by Klimov (1977,
pp. 125–126); cf. also
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref49">Sapir (1911)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>In this paper, we retain Yanagida’s (2007a, b) analysis of OJ as a language involving
split alignment and in particular her incorporation analysis of examples like (6). The
incorporation analysis is dicussed in Sec. 4. However we do not retain the hypothesis
that the adnominal suffix is a vestigial antipassive, for the following reasons.</p>
      <p>
        First, the function of antipassive in ergative languages is to make the clause
[-transitive], resulting in assignment of absolutive case to the external argument. But
4 Antipassives are common in strictly ergative languages: transitive subjects are marked by absolutive
case and objects by oblique case. It is widely claimed that the historical shift from ergative to accusative
languages results from reanalysis of antipassives as accusative transitives
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">(e.g., Bittner and Hale 1996)</xref>
        .
5 Miyagawa (1989, footnote 7) recognizes four counter-examples to the generalization that direct objects
in adnominal clauses are uniformly marked with wo in OJ. Miyagawa suggests that the examples are
noun-verb compounds. In fact, the number of bare N0 + verb examples in the Man’y oˆshuˆ is much larger,
and the quantity and lexical variety of these examples indicate a productive process of noun incorporation
rather than lexicalized compounds.
adnominal marking does not have this effect in OJ: the external argument in
transitive adnominal clauses is marked with ergative (active) case (ga), not absolutive.
Second, if adnominal marking in relative clauses was a kind of antipassive, we
would expect it to be associated only with subject relatives. This is because of the
so-called Absolutive Restriction on A-Bar extraction
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">(Aldridge 2004)</xref>
        , which allows
only absolutive arguments to undergo relativization (recall that the transitive subject
becomes absolutive in antipassives). But the OJ adnominal is used to form relatives
of all types (cf (2a), an adjunct relative). Crucially, the adnominal is also used to
derive object relatives:
(7)
垂乳根之 母我養蚕
[taratine no papa ga kap-u] kwo
Mk Gen mother Act breed-Adn silkworm
‘the silkworms bred by my mother’
(MY 12/2991)
This is unexpected if the adnominal was an antipassive morpheme.
      </p>
      <p>
        The third problem with the antipassive hypothesis is morphological. Any
arguments for analyzing the adnominal as a vestigial antipassive holds for the
other nominalized clause types as well since they all occur with ga-marked
agentive subjects and wo-marked objects in the order OSV. But each of these
clause types involves a completely different affix: realis -e-/-ure-, irrealis
conditional -a-, nominal -aku. This means that there would be no specific morpheme
marking the antipassive. The fourth and final problem is semantic. In ergative
languages, the object argument in antipassives (if realized at all) is typically
indefinite or non-referential
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">(Dixon 1994, p. 148)</xref>
        . But wo-marked objects in OJ
are typically definite
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">(Motohashi 1989)</xref>
        . Again, this fact is unexpected if wo
originated as the oblique case marker for objects in antipassives.
      </p>
      <p>
        In fact, the expectation that an active language should have an antipassive is a
product of the view that active is a subtype of ergative alignment. This view has
been pervasive in the typological literature since at least Dixon (1979, pp. 80–85),
but it is by no means the only view. Other typologists, in particular, Klimov (1974,
1977, pp. 29–43) have claimed that the two alignment types are distinct
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17 ref3 ref34">(see also
Wichmann 2008 and the papers collected in Wichmann and Donohue 2008)</xref>
        . We
argue in the next section, on empirical and formal grounds, that the latter view is
correct. In particular, the feature [ transitive], which plays a crucial role in the
assignment of ergative case and in the derivation of the antipassive in ergative
languages, does not play this role in active languages.
      </p>

active alignment before going on to show how these properties apply to OJ.</p>

      <title>3.1 Split intransitivity</title>
      <p>Active languages divide intransitive verbs into active and inactive. The exact lexical
division differs cross-linguistically, but the two classes of intransitive verbs are
distinguished by case marking: active intransitive subjects (SA, typically the agent
argument of unergatives) have the same marking as transitive subjects whereas
inactive intransitive subjects (SO, typically the patient argument of unaccusatives)
have the same marking as transitive objects. In Hindi, for example, verbs in
perfective aspect show an active pattern: the case marker –ne appears on the subject of
transitives and unergatives but not on the subject of unaccusatives:

      <title>3.2 The nominal hierarchy</title>
      <p>We noted in Sect. 2 that the typological literature has tended to classify active as a
subtype of ergative alignment. One argument against this view is that active
languages differ crucially from ergative languages with respect to how ergative splits
interact with Silverstein’s (1976) nominal hierarchy:
(12)</p>
      <p>
        The Nominal Hierarchy (Silverstein 1976)

common nouns

        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">Dixon (1979)</xref>
        emphasizes that languages termed ergative invariably show splits, that
is, nominative/accusative features in certain contexts. This interacts with the
nominal hierarchy. Dixon (1979, pp. 86–87) interprets the hierarchy to ‘‘roughly
indicate the overall ‘agency potential’ of any given NP’’ and observes that ‘‘a
number of languages have ‘split’ case marking exactly on this principle: an
‘ergative’ case is used with NPs from the right-hand end up to some point in the
middle of the hierarchy and an ‘accusative’ case from that point on, over to the
extreme left of the hierarchy.’’ This is exemplified by Thulung Rai
(TibetoBurman), an ergative language. The suffix –ka marks A when when it is lower on
the hierarchy

opposite direction as first suggested by

In Lakhota, the first and second person pronouns wa and ma display an active

Independent NPs appear neither with morphological cases nor adpositions. As
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">Mithun
(1991)</xref>
        points out, case systems based on agency are frequently restricted to
nominals referring to human beings. 7 Thus Koasati shows agentive case marking on
pronominal prefixes within verbs but accusative case marking on nouns. The
active system in Batsbi (Tsova-Tush) is limited to first and second persons.
7
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">Mithun (1991)</xref>
        identifies the semantic basis of the active marking of various West Hemisphere
languages, both synchronically and diachronically.
Central Pomo has an active system in nominals referring to humans only. The
Georgian active system is restricted to human beings. The Yuki system is
restricted to animates. From these cross-linguistic observations, the implication
follows that active marking is used with NPs from the left-hand side to the
righthand side of the nominal hierarchy; that is, if a language has agent marking in
third person, it also has agent marking in first and second person. This is exactly
the opposite of the right-to-left application of the hierarchy proposed by Dixon for
ergative languages. The relationship between active marking and the nominal
hierachy is stated in (16):
(16)
      </p>
      <p>The Active Marking Hierarchy
In active languages, if active marking applies to an NP type a, it applies
to every NP type to the left of a on the nominal hierarchy.</p>
      <p>The preceding discussion shows that assignment of active case is dependent not
just on the thematic role assigned by the verb but on the place of S on the nominal
hierarchy. Klimov (1974, 1979) emphasizes this point, stressing that in active
languages the semantics of both the predicate and the subject NP govern the
distribution of active case.</p>
      <p>
        Dixon (1979, pp. 80–83) divides active languages into two groups; ‘‘split S’’
languages such as Tup´ı-Guaran´ı and ‘‘fluid S’’ langauges such as Batsbi. In split-S
systems, the two classes of intransitive verbs have fixed membership, and whether
they belong to the active or inactive class is based on their prototypical meaning. In
fluid S systems, verbs are divided depending on the meaning of each particular
token. The active pattern appears when the S argument has control over the activity,
and the inactive pattern appears when control is lacking. Consider Batsbi, a fluid S
language cited by

      <p>In (17a) the activity is unintentional, and the subject is marked absolutive while
in (18b) the activity involves intention, and the subject is marked ergative/active.</p>
      <p>
        Summarizing, the distribution of active of SA marking can vary along three
dimensions: the prototypical meaning of the verb (whether it is agentive or
nonagentive), the degree of control associated with the S argument, and the place of S on
the nominal hierarchy.
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">Legate (2008)</xref>
        provides a framework that can capture these
properties and distinguish active from ergative systems. In Legate’s framework, the
external argument in ergative languages receives inherent ergative case in its
underlying position in the specifier of [+transitive] vPs. [The analysis of ergative as
inherent case assigned to the external argument in situ originates with Woolford
(1997) and is shared by such researchers as
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">Aldridge (2004)</xref>
        ]. In active languages,
transitivity plays no role: inherent Active case is assigned to the external argument
in Spec, vP regardless of whether or not v is [+transitive]. We propose that other
features may also play a role in the assignment of inherent active case, including
person features and semantic features such as [ animate]. This allows us to
account for languages where NP type determines the distribution of active
case.

      <title>4.1 Agent marking with ga</title>
      <p>In modern Tokyo Japanese, ga is clearly a nominative case marker because it marks

as in (18).

The distribution of ga in OJ differs significantly from present-day Japanese. Ga
in OJ is one of two genitive markers; the other is no, which retains this status in
modern Japanese. In addition to marking possessors of NP inside DP, both ga
and no also mark the subjects of nominalized clauses. Ga is restricted to
personal nouns whose referent is someone close to the speaker, such as imo ‘sister,
wife, lover’, or a pronoun with a specific human referent. No, on the other hand,
is used with nonspecific animate nouns, such as pito ‘other people’, and with
inanimate nouns.8 The use of ga depends not only on the semantics of the DP it
marks but also on the semantics of the predicate. In nominalized clauses, ga is

special significance such as tadu ‘crane’ and siwa ‘snipe’ are marked with ga. These are almost certainly

The first and second pronouns wa and na are weak pronominal counterparts of the

In (22a), the predicate yuku means ‘go.’ Its subject is human and volitional and
marked with ga. In (22b) yuku means ‘flow.’ Its inanimate subject Asuka-gapa
‘Asuka river’ is morphologically unmarked. The choice of subject marking depends
on whether the event denoted by the verb involves control or intention: only the
human participant exercises control. Thus OJ nominal clauses are a fluid-S system,
in Dixon’s sense described in Sect. 3.1.
11 Approximately 120 occurrences of subject (w)a-ga are found in the Man’y oˆsh uˆ (based on the
Yoshimura’s electronic text); all are immediately adjacent to the verb. (Data cited here include personal
pronouns written with phonographs but not the freestanding ideograph吾, which can be read with or
without a case particle.)
Given the strict adjacency condition, we assume that the weak pronominals are
clitics adjoined directly to the verb.</p>
      <p>We see from the semantic differences between ga and no that ga marks NPs higher
on the nominal hierarchy in (12) whereas no is used with NPs located lower on the
hierarchy. This generalization applies both to ga and no as possessors of NP and
markers of subjects (A and S) in nominalized clauses. Note that syncretism between
genitive and agentive case is common in non-accusative languages. For clarity, we
gloss ga as Act(ive) when it marks the SA of a nominalized clause and as Gen(itive)
when it marks the possessor in DP. No is glossed as Gen(itive) throughout.</p>

      <title>4.2 Ga/no marking and nominalized clause types</title>
      <p>Subjects marked with ga and no appear in the clause types we have characterized as
nominalized: adnominal (rentaikei), realis (izenkei), irrealis (mizenkei)
conditionals, and –aku nominalizations, but they never appear with predicates in the
conclusive form.12 Let us look more closely at the evidence that these clause types
have nominalized status synchronically at the OJ period. First, as described above,
their subjects appear with the genitive case particles ga and no. The semantic
distribution of ga and no in marking the possessor in DPs is parallel to their distribution
in nominalized clauses: possessors lower on the nominal hierarchy appear with no
while NPs higher on the hierarchy, such as personal pronouns, appear with ga:</p>

wakayu tur-u imo ga tamoto
young.sweetfish angle-Adn girl Gen wrist
‘the arms of my girl who fishes for young sweetfish’
(MY 1/79)
(MY 5/857)</p>
      <p>Second, the four clause types appear in positions typical of nominalized clauses:
embedded complement and modifier positions and focus constructions, including
questions. Whitman (1997) shows that it is common, particularly in East and
Southeast Asia, for focus and interrogative patterns to be realized with nominalizing
morphology on the predicate. Adnominal clauses appear as focus and interrogative
questions, as the object of a postposition or as the subject of a clause. Realis clauses
appear as questions as focus constructions with the particle koso and as presupposed
conditionals typically followed by the particles –ba ‘as/since’ and –do ‘even
(though)’. Irrealis conditionals appear with the same two particles. Nominalized
–aku clauses are analyzed as nominalizations by Wrona (2008) and typically occur
in complement position. All of the environments above are embedded, all
complements of a verb or particle or modifier of NP, except for the focus and question
constructions associated with the adnominal and realis.</p>
      <p>
        In this paper we adopt the view that nominalization involves a [nominal] feature
associated with the lexical verb and percolated to T, the head of the extended verbal
12
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">Sasaki (1996)</xref>
        cites seven examples from the Man’yôshû in which he claims that ga appears with a
predicate in the conclusive form. (We exclude examples involving the character 之 since this character
can be read either as the case marker ga /no or the focus adverbial si.) (21b) above is one of the examples
cited by Sasaki; closer inspection of his data reveals that in six out of Sasaki’s seven examples, as in
(21b), the subject is not in the conclusive to-clause but in the higher clause whose predicate is in the
adnominal form. The structure of these six clauses, as in (21b), is [Subject-gai [proi …Vconc] Vadn ], where
the embedded subject is a phonologically null pro coindexed with the ga-marked subject in the higher
adnominal clause.
projection. 13 The fact that the domain of nominalization in OJ is TP is shown by the
ability of the adnominal, realis, and irrealis conditional endings to select tense,
negation, and modals such as presumptive -mu. In (2a–b), (20a), and (21), for
instance, we see examples of the adnominal form of the past tense auxiliary, spelled
out as -si. The ‘high’ locus of nominalization in OJ brings to mind languages
like Turkish
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">(Kornfilt 2003)</xref>
        , where nominalization is at the clausal level.14 The
concrete representation we propose for OJ nominalized clauses with ga-marked
subjects is given in (24), corresponding to (21b).

[Nominal] v assigns inherent active case (spelled out as ga) to external arguments in
its specifier. Ga thus appears on the subjects of transitives and unergatives as
described in Sect. 4.1. In addition, inherent ga is subject to additional featural
restrictions typical of active languages as discussed in Sect. 3.2, such as the
restriction that the active-marked DP be [animate].</p>
        <p>
          In contrast, genitive no is a structural case, assigned by D in DPs such as (23a).
We assume that D is also responsible for assigning no to the subjects of nominalized
clauses such as those in (20), much as in modern Japanese
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">(see Miyagawa 1993 for
an analysis of D as the licenser of no-marked genitive subjects in modern Japanese)</xref>
          .
The mechanism of subject no-marking is discussed in greater detail in Sect. 4.4.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this section we have described a dependent marking pattern in OJ characeristic
of active alignment: ga marking of A and SA in nominalized clauses. In the next
section we show that OJ also displayed head marking patterns characteristic of
active alignment.
13 This contrasts with approaches that posit a category-fixing head n that selects an acategorial root
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">(Marantz 1997)</xref>
          or vP
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">(Alexiadou 2001)</xref>
          . Such an approach is not impossible in OJ, but the category-fixing
head would have to select T.
14 However, in Turkish the locus of nominalization is higher than in OJ:
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">Kornfilt (2003)</xref>
          places it in the
Agr or Finite head where subject agreement is spelled out above the Tense-Aspect- Modal projections.
OJ, like modern J, has no overt agreement morphology in this position, nor is there any overt Finite or C
morpheme above the TAM (Tense/Modal/Aspect) auxiliaries. Instead what we find are adnominal, etc.
allomorphs of these auxiliaries. For this reason we interpret the adnominal and other nominalized forms
as the spellout of [nominal] T.

      <title>4.3 Active/inactive prefixes</title>
      <p>A heretofore completely unnoticed piece of evidence for the active alignment of OJ
comes from the verbal prefixes i- and sa-. Japanese traditional linguists have failed
to identify a consistent semantic or syntactic function for these prefixes. But careful
analysis shows that i- is attached to active verbs, and sa- to inactive verbs. These
two prefixes appear almost exclusively in nominalized, as well as infinitive, clauses.
4.3.1 i- on active verbs
The prefix i- is richly attested in the Man’yoˆ shuˆ , as in (25a–b).
(25)
a. 楢乃京師乃</p>
      <p>Nara no miyakwo
Nara Gen capital</p>
      <p>佐保川尓 伊去至而
no Sapo kawa ni i-yuki itarite
Gen Saho River–Loc i-go reaching
(MY 1/79)
‘I reached the River Sahokawa in Nara.’
b. 久米能若子我 伊觸家武</p>
      <p>Kume no wakugwo ga i-pure-kyem-u
Kume Gen youth Act i-touch-PConj-Adn
礒之草根
iswo no kusa no ne
rock Gen grass Gen root (MY 1/435)
‘the root of the grass that the youth of Kume would have touched.’
A total of 74 occurrences of i- are found in the Man’yoˆ shuˆ . The distribution of
i- parallels that of the case marker ga: both appear in nominalized clauses, i.e.,
irrealis (mizenkei) conditionals and -aku nominal, adnominal (rentaikei), and
realis (izenkei) clauses.

The prefix i- attaches to active verbs
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24 ref32">(all tokens of i- in the Man’yoˆ shuˆ are cited in
Yanagida 2007b)</xref>
        . There are a number of cases in which i- is prefixed to the
unergative verb yuku ‘go’ but no examples in which i- is prefixed to the unaccusative
verb kuru ‘come’. There are a few examples in which i- is prefixed to what appear to
be nonagentive verbs, such as (27).
15 The parentheses on the totals for conclusive and imperative examples of i- indicate that all three of
these examples are subject to alternative analyses, as discussed below.
三輪乃 山. . . 奈良能山乃 山際
Miwa no yama . . . Nara no yama no yama no ma ni
Miwa Gen mountain Nara Gen mountain Gen mountain among
伊隠万代 道隈 伊積流万代尓 (MY 1/17)
i-kakur-u made miti no kuma i-tumor-u made ni
i-hide-Adn until road Gen bend i-amass-Adn until Loc
‘Mt. Miwa. . . until you hide yourself among the mountains of Nara,
until you loom in the bends of the road’
Although we might expect (27) to be interpreted as inactive since the subject Miwa-no
yama ‘Mt Miwa’is superficially inanimate, the clause is interpreted as
personificational by all Japanese commentators.16 The use of i- here thus fits with our
characterization of OJ as a fluid-S language in the previous section: ostensibly
nonagentive verbs may appear with active marking when they have human (or
personified) subjects.
      </p>
      <p>Unlike active marking ga, i- also appears in infinitive (renyoˆ kei) clauses. But in
infinitive clauses too, the prefixed verb is unfailingly active in all of the clearly
interpretable examples. Of the 44 examples of i- prefixed to a verb in the infinitive,
18 involve the unergative verb yuk- ‘go’. The overwhelming majority of i+infinitive
clauses have agentive empty (pro) subjects.17</p>
      <p>In addition to being restricted to active verbs, we see from the table in (23) that
i- occurs almost exclusively with the clause types we have identified as nominalized
or in infinitive clauses with agentive pro subjects. None of the threee potential
counter-examples to this generalization are written with phonograms. Kojima et al.
(1995, vol. 3, p. 369) interpret the single potential imperative example (MYS 3169)
as not involving prefixal i- but rather the honorific verb of displacement
imas‘go/come (Honorific)’.18 In fact, both of the potential conclusive examples, MYS
1916 and 3885, are open to this same interpretation, as both involve honorific
subjects and a verb with the meaning ‘go’ written in Chinese characters. If this
interpretation is correct, there are no examples of i- occurring with imperative or
conclusive predicates.
16 Wrona (2006) cites the second clause of (27) miti no kuma i-tumor-u as a counter-example to the
generalization that i- appears only on active verbs, interpreting this clause as ‘bends of the road pile up’.
This interpretation is also followed by Kojima et al. (1995) and Satake et al. (2002). But Nakanishi (1978/
2004) interprets personificational ‘Mt. Miwa’ as the subject of both clauses. Because this preserves the
evident parallelism of the two clauses, we have followed Nakanishi’s interpretation here.
17 To be precise, 40 of the 44 infinitive examples have human agentive pro subjects. Two have
personificational subjects, shirakum(w)o mo ‘white clouds too’ (MY 317) and amakum(w)o mo
‘skyclouds too’ (MY 319), both occurring with unergative i-YUKI ‘i+going’. Both NPs are marked with the
subdued focus marker mo ‘too/even’ suggesting that they are external to the infinitive clause. Only two
examples have possible clause-internal non-agentive subjects, but both of these (MY 2145 and 3409) are
problematic of interpretation. MY 2145 is particularly instructive. Kojima et al. (1995, vol. 3, p. 111) note
that the infinitive clause in question sa-wosika no kowe i-tuki i-tuki ‘the voice of the buck i-continuing,
i-continuing’ must be interpreted in context as an elliptical realis (izenkei) conditional: ‘when pro hears
the voice of the buck’.
18 Satake et al. (2002, vol .3, p. 205) also acknowledge this interpretation.</p>
      <p>Summing up, the OJ verbal prefix i- is restricted to active verbs. It occurs only
with nominalized predicates—the domain we have associated with ergative-active
alignment—and infinitives with agentive pro subjects.
4.3.2 sa- on Inactive verbs
The prefix sa- differs crucially from i- in that it appears only on inactive verbs,
as in (28).

There are 30 tokens of the prefix sa- on verbs, including neru ‘sleep’, niturapu
‘shine’, pasiru ‘(fish) run’, wodoru ‘(birds) dance’, wataru ‘(toads) cross’, nebapu
‘spread roots’, narabu ‘(birds) line up’, kumoru ‘get cloudy’, nituku ‘get
reddened’. All the verbs are intransitive, and all have non-agentive subjects (aside from
ne- ‘sleep’, all are nonhuman).

        Total
Like i-, the prefix sa- is used overwhelmingly (25/30 tokens) in nominalized
clauses. 19 Sa- also occurs in the Man’yoˆ shuˆ as a noun prefix, as in sa-yo ‘night’
while i- does not. This parallels exactly the distribution of agreement prefixes in
active languages such as Satere´ -Mawe´
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">(Meira 2006)</xref>
        : inactive prefixes occur on
nouns and inactive verbs while active prefixes occur on active verbs only.20,21
      </p>
      <p>Alexander Vovin (p.c.) points out to us that one verb in OJ, wataru ‘cross’,
appears with either i- or sa-. There are four examples of i-watar- in the Man’yoˆ shuˆ
(MY 1742, 2081, 4101, and 4126), and six examples of sa-watar- (MY 800, 971,
1960, 1976, 2450, and 2804). The S of i-watar- is [+human] and volitional in all
four examples: ‘the young woman,’ ‘Tanabata’ (Vega, the weaver star), ‘the
fisherfolk,’ and ‘Vega and Altair.’ The S of sa-watar- is [-human] in all six examples:
‘toads’ (800, 971), ‘a cuckoo’ (1960, 1976), ‘the moon,’ ‘a teal’. Typical examples
of each pattern are given in (30).22</p>

‘the girl I saw faintly like the moon sa-crossing from among the clouds’
I-watar- ‘cross (over the bridge)’ is agentive volitional, and telic, a stereotypical
active verb. Sa-watar- is non-agentive and designates not a completed action but the
19 Three of the five counter-examples involve ne- ‘sleep’ with human subjects: conclusive (MY 2782)
and two with imperative (MY 636, 2629). Since sa-ne ‘sa+sleeping’ also occurs as a noun, these
examples may be back formations. The remaining two counter-examples, conclusive MY 859 and 4156,
both involve the collocation ayu sa-basiru ‘the sweetfish sa-runs’.
20 Satere´-Mawe´ (Tupian) has an active system marked by two series of personal prefixes on the verb
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">(cf.
Mithun 1991)</xref>
        .
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">Meira (2006)</xref>
        shows that in Mawe´ nonactive verbs are strikingly similar to (possessed)
nouns: the same set of personal prefixes appears on nouns and nonactive verbs; these prefixes do not
select active verbs.
21 On both nouns and verbs sa- (but not i-) triggers rendaku (realized in OJ as prenasalization) on the
following voiceless obstruent. This suggests an etymological source of the shape *saN(V). *Sa may be
related to the mesial pronouns sa ‘thus’, so ‘that’, and si ‘s/he it’ while *N(V) appears related to genitive/
inactive no.
22 Commenting on (30b), Kojima et al. (1995, vol. 3, p. 191) observe exactly the distinction we describe here
between i-watar- and sa-watar-. They note that while i-watar- occurs only with human subjects, sa-watar- is
restricted to nonhuman subjects. They fail to extend this distinction to other verbs, however.
as ‘the moon’ in (30b) receive no rather than bare marking. 25 Under this analysis,
no-marking is licensed by a higher head, outside the active alignment system of OJ
nominalized clauses.
      </p>
      <p>Turning now to conclusive clauses, unmarked subjects occur freely both as the
external argument of a transitive and the internal argument of an unaccusative, as
shown in (33).

Bare objects as in (33b) in conclusive clauses can be analyzed as receiving
structural accusative case from v, as proposed by
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">Miyagawa (1989)</xref>
        . Bare subjects as in
(33a) can be analyzed as receiving nominative case from T, as in modern Japanese
(Takezawa 1987). While the phonological exponence of nominative and accusative
case differs, the syntactic mechanisms for case marking in OJ conclusive clauses are
essentially the same as in modern Japanese. However, the sharp difference between
the patterns in conclusive and nominalized clauses confirms that OJ was a language
with split alignment: while conclusive clauses follow a nominative-accusative
pattern, distinguishing S/A and O, nominalized clauses show an active pattern,
distinguishing SA and SO and grouping SA with A. In the next section we turn to
object marking in nominalized clauses.
25 We leave the precise landing site of no-marked unaccusative subjects in OJ for future research.

        As we saw in Sect. 2.1,
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">Miyagawa (1989)</xref>
        argues that in Early Middle and Old
Japanese, adnominal predicates fail to assign accusative case, and hence an object
must be licensed by morphological case in the form of wo in order to avoid a
violation of the Case Filter. There are, however, a number of OJ examples in which
an adnominal predicate takes an object lacking a morphological case, which are thus
apparent counter-examples to Miyagawa’s (1989) generalization. Yanagida (2007b)
shows that in the Man’yoˆ shuˆ there are 90 tokens of transitive clauses whose subject
is marked by no or ga and whose object is morphologically unmarked. Fifty-five
occur with attributive predicates, as in (35).
5 Object marking in nominalized clauses
This section discusses the two patterns of object marking in nominalized clauses.
We focus on adnominal clauses because of their higher frequency, but the same
generalizations hold for the three other types of nominalized clauses.
a. 佐欲比賣能故何 比列布利斯
      </p>
      <p>Saywopimye no kwo ga pire puri-si
Sayohime Gen child Act scarf wave-Past.Adn

b. 之加乃白水郎之 燒塩煙風</p>

Shika Gen fishermen Gen salt burn-Adn smoke
‘the smoky haze raising when fishermen of Shika burn salt’
(MY 5/868)
However, while bare objects do occur with adnominal predicates, there is a clear
pattern to the counter-examples. The bare objects are almost without exception
nonbranching N0s. Of the 55 examples of this type, only one has a phrasal object, MY
2639 in (36):26
(36)
憑也君之 吾之名告兼
Tanome ya kimi ga waga na norikyem-u? (MY 11/2639)
Trust Foc/Q lord Act my name state-PConj-Adn
‘Is it because (he) trusts in me, that my Lord has stated my name?’
In relative clauses, where the predicate is realized in the adnominal form, bare
objects are systematically non-branching, as in (37) (see Appendix 1 for possible
exceptions).
26 It should also be noted that on the clitic analysis of pronoun þ ga (4.1, Yanagida 2007b), the bare
object wa ga na ‘my name’ in (36) is not, strictly speaking, phrasal.
(MY 6/936)

b. Ytlyg-yn qaa-tym-gʔe.</p>
      <p>
        father-Abs deer-killed-3SG
‘The father killed a deer.’
Based on these distributional facts, we propose that bare objects in nominalized
clauses like (35) are to be analyzed on analogy with incorporated objects in
Chukchee (Spencer 1999):
Chukchee is a split ergative language that has two types of derived intransitive
constructions with semantically transitive verbs (Spencer 1999). One is the
antipassive in (38a), where O is marked with oblique case and A is absolutive; the
second, restricted to N0 objects, is the object incorporation strategy in (38b). The
incorporation strategy for objects is also widely attested in American languages
displaying active alignment
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref49">(Sapir 1911)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        We propose that OJ uses the incorporation strategy for bare objects, like
Chuckchee. Following the basic approach of
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">Baker (1988)</xref>
        , non-branching nouns
immediately adjacent to an adnominal predicate are incorporated into the verb, and
incorporation satisfies the case requirements of the incorporee. This preserves
Miyagawa’s generalization that the object of the adnominal predicate is not assigned
abstract case in its base position.
      </p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-17">
      <title>5.2 Wo-marked objects</title>
      <p>
        Vovin (1997), developing the hypothesis that OJ is an active language, proposes that
wo is an absolutive case marker because it marks not only the objects of transitive
verbs but also the subjects of non-active intransitives, primarily adjectives. Most of
these occur in a pattern involving the adjectival stem plus the suffix -mi:
(39)
久左麻久良 多婢乎久流之美 故非乎礼婆
kusa makura tabi wo kurusi-mi kopi wor-eba (MY15/3674)
grass pillow travel Obj painful-mi long.for be-when
‘as I am longing for (my wife) travel being painful’
There are also some examples in which a subject marked by wo occurs with inactive
predicates followed by the complementizer to (40):
(40) a. 世間乎 宇之等夜佐之等

(MY20/4436)
‘that dear girl, who asked when I would come back’
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">Miyagawa and Ekida (2003)</xref>
        propose that examples like (40a–b) are instances of
exceptional case marking (ECM), on the assumption that wo is the spellout of
abstract case assigned by the matrix verb. Yanagida (2006) argues that OJ has no
ECM construction and that wo-marked subjects in the pattern with to-clauses as in
(40a–b) are arguments of the higher verb (which, as we observe, has a nominalized
inflection, realis and adnominal, respectively).27 Under either analysis, wo is
assigned not by the embedded intransitive predicate but by the matrix transitive
verb. Note that this leaves open the status of the NP wo…-mi pattern, to which we
return at the end of this section.
      </p>
      <p>
        The strongest argument against the analysis of wo as an absolutive marker is that the
subject of a non-active intransitive verb is never marked by wo in adnominal, realis or
irrealis conditionals, or –aku nominal clauses. It is either morphologically unmarked
or marked by genitive no, as discussed in section 4 and exemplified by (41–42).

b. 宇能花能 佐久都奇
u no pana no sak-u tukwi

‘the month when the utsugi blossom is in bloom.’
If wo was an absolutive case marker, we would have no explanation for why the
subject is never marked by wo in the contexts given in (41–42).
      </p>
      <p>
        The particle wo differs significantly from its descendant o in modern Japanese in
that it marks not only direct objects but all kinds of VP-internal arguments including
quasi-adjuncts
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">(cf. Motohashi 1989)</xref>
        . In (43a), wo marks the goal argument, and in
(43b–e) it marks source, locative, and time adjuncts. In (43f–g) wo co-occurs with a
locative adjunct marked by ni, ‘in/at’.

These facts make it difficult to analyze wo merely as the spellout of VP-internal
structural case. In (43f–g), for example, it is unclear why structural case would be
required for PPs headed by the locative postposition ni.</p>
      <p>This property correlates with the generalization about the word order of OJ clauses
containing wo mentioned in section 1. As shown by Yanagida (2006), the relative
position of the subject and the wo-marked object is such that the latter always precedes
the former, as shown in (4) and (19a).28 Additional examples are given for adnominal
(44a), -aku (44b), and realis (44c) clauses below. (See Appendix 2 for a preliminary
correlation of conjugational forms with wo-marking in the Man’yoˆ shu.)

        In addition to this regularity about their word order, it has been observed by
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">Motohashi (1989)</xref>
        that wo-marked phrases tend to be definite. In fact the
generalization is slightly broader: wo-marked phrases are specific. This can be shown by
the fact that wh-pronouns can be marked by wo, but when they are, they receive a
specific interpretation in contrast to bare wh-pronouns. This is shown in the contrast
between the following two examples.

at home asks for gifts from the shore, which (other) shall I offer her?’
(MY 3/360)
(MY 11/2519)
In (45), the universe of things the speaker might do is completely undefined in
previous discourse. In (46), in contrast, the set of items that the speaker might offer
his wife is defined as pamadutwo ‘gifts from the shore’. In this case nani wo ‘what/
which Obj’ picks out specific items from that set.
      </p>
      <p>Yanagida (2006) analyzes the properties of adnominal clauses as in (47):</p>
      <p>Case and argument realization in OJ
(i) Ga-marked subjects stay in the base external argument position
(Spec, vP).
(ii) Bare objects are incorporated into the verb.
(iii) Wo-marked objects obligatorily move to the outer Spec of vP,
to check their [definite] feature.</p>
      <p>Here we revise this analysis to take into account the new data reviewed in this section.
First, the properties in (47) apply to nominalized clauses generally. Second,
movement of wo-marked phrases is not triggered by a definite feature since wo-marked
footnote 29 continued
However, this example is open to at least one other interpretation, where Sapywopime ga is taken as the
possessive modifier of ‘this mountain’, i.e., ‘On this, Sayohime’s mountain, might she have waved her
scarf (saying) . . .’ A reviewer of Yanagida (2006) also cites MY 18/4036 as a counter-example, but this is
based on a misinterpretation of this example.
XPs may include wh-phrases and PPs, among other items. Instead, we would like the
specificity of wo-marked phrases to be a by-product of their movement.</p>
      <p>
        We can capture these generalizations by returning to the basic insight of
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">Miyagawa
(1989)</xref>
        : the verbal projection in nominalized clauses does not assign structural case.
We saw in Sect. 4 that under the active analysis the ga-marked agent in nominaized
clauses remains in Spec, vP and receives inherent case there. Following Miyagawa’s
original proposal, we hypothesize that [nominal] v does not bear an accusative case
feature. This leaves two options for case licensing objects: incorporation, in the case
of nonbranching objects, or case assignment by a head above vP.
      </p>
      <p>
        As we have seen, wo is realized to the left of the external argument, indicating that
it is indeed assigned by a head above vP. There are two possible candidates for the
identity of this head. One is T; this would bring OJ into line with analyses of certain
ergative languages where absolutive case is assigned by T (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">Aldridge (2004)</xref>
        ,
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">Legate
(2008)</xref>
        ). The drawback of this approach is that OJ wo, as discussed above, does not
show the distribution of a standard absolutive case: it does not appear on the subjects
of inactive (or any kind of intransitive) verb. A possible way around this difficulty is to
expand the analysis of nominative case assigned by T in nominalized clauses
presented in Sect. 4.4. We proposed there that bare theme subjects are assigned
nominative case by T selecting a defective vP in nominalized clauses. It could be
hypothesized that nominative case is also assigned by T selecting nondefective, that
is, transitive or unergative vP, but that nominative in this instance is spelled out as wo.
An analysis along these lines seems possible, but it has the flavor of a stipulation, so
we will not pursue it further here.
      </p>
      <p>The second option is that wo is assigned by a functional head between v and T.
We propose that wo-marked DPs reside in the specifier of AspectP. Washio (2004)
shows that aspect selection in OJ was sensitive to transitivity, suggesting that
AspectP, rather than vP, was the locus for a [ transitive] feature. We hypothesize that
[þtransitive] Aspect in OJ bears an EPP (Extended Projection Principle) feature that
attracts the highest non-inherently case marked argument in the verbal projection to
its specifier, as shown in (48).</p>

          ) hypothesis that bare NPs extracted from the nuclear scope of the
clause receive a specific interpretation explains the [specific] property of wo marked
phrases.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that this analysis correlates wo-marking and the position of wo-marked
arguments with the presence of [+transitive] AspectP in nominalized clauses. We
leave open the question of wo-marking in the other major clause types: conclusive,
infinitive, and imperative. We show in Appendix 2 that wo-marking also occurs in
these clauses, but as observed by
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">Miyagawa (1989)</xref>
          and
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">Miyagawa and Ekida
(2003)</xref>
          , it is more restricted. In conclusive clauses, it is largely restricted to
propositional attitude verbs of thinking or saying while in imperative clauses
wo-marking seems to have been a mid-eighth century innovation, probably
triggered by the phonological merger of certain infinitive and imperative endings.
        </p>
        <p>
          The AspectP analysis extends naturally to Vovin’s characterization of the wo …
–mi pattern in (39). AspectP is identified as the head of participial-type
nominalization in analyses such as
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">Embick (2004)</xref>
          and
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">Alexiadou and Anagnostopoulou
(2008)</xref>
          . Unlike the object Equi wo-marking pattern in (40), the wo-marked subject
in wo…-mi clauses is not susceptible to a matrix object (or ECM) analysis because
wo…–mi clauses are adjuncts, typically expressing reason or cause. We analyze the
wo…–mi pattern as adjunct AspPs, analagous to Acc-ing gerunds such as ‘travel
being painful’ in English:
(49) [AspP tabi wo [VP kurusi ]mi] kofi wor-eba
        </p>
        <p>travel Acc painful-mi long.for be-when
‘as I long for my wife, travel being painful’
On this analysis, -mi is the spellout of the head of [þtransitive] AspP. The
stipulation that –mi is [+transitive] may have a diachronic motivation, as one etymology
for –mi derives it from the infinitive of the transitive verb mi- ‘see’. Wo… -mi
clauses do not contain tense, which is consistent with our hypothesis that wo is
assigned by a functional head lower than T.</p>
        <p>
          Summarizing the results of this section, we have shown that OJ had two
mechanisms for case marking objects in nominalized clauses: incorporation and
womarking above vP. The inability of v in nominalized clauses to assign accusative
case is a direct extension Miyagawa’s (1989) original hypothesis. More generally,
as we discuss in detail in Sect. 6.2, the active alignment properties of OJ
nominalized clauses fit into the cross-linguistic pattern identified by ‘‘nominalist’’
analyses of non-accusative alignment such as
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">Johns (1992)</xref>
          and
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">Kaufman (2007)</xref>
          .
[Nominal] v is unable to check the case feature of the object. Objects must therefore
be case licensed by other strategies: assignment of ‘absolutive’ case by T
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1 ref34">(Aldridge
2004; Legate 2008)</xref>
          , default absolutive
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">(Legate 2008)</xref>
          , incorporation, or, in the
instance of OJ, case assigment by a functional head above vP.
6 Alignment and nominalization in diachronic and typological perspective
We have seen that OJ active alignment is restricted to the clause types we have
called ‘nominalized’: adnominal (rentaikei), nominal complements in –aku, and
realis (izenkei) and irrealis (mizenkei) conditionals. We have shown how the
nominalized properties of these clauses are intimately linked with their active
properties: nominalized clauses assign inherent agentive ga in Spec, vP, and
[transitive] Aspect in these clauses attracts complements to a position above the
external argument, where they receive wo-marking. In Sect. 6.1 we discuss the
diachronic sources for the nominalized clause patterns in OJ. In Sect. 6.2 we show
that nominalizations are a widely attested cross-linguistic source for non-accusative
alignment. We focus on a specific case, Cariban languages as analyzed by Gildea
(1998, 2000), and point out that it suggests a possible source for the wo-marking
pattern in OJ. Section 6.3 discusses changes possibly already underway in OJ,
involving the genitive/subject marker no.
6.1 The nominalizing origins of the adnominal and irrealis conditional endings
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">Konoshima (1962)</xref>
          seems to have been the first to argue that the nominalizing or
juntaigen ‘quasi-nominal’ function of the adnominal endings was primary, and its NP
modifying function secondary. Adnominal clauses in OJ have the distribution of [þN]
categories, i.e., NPs and uninflected adjectives. Like NPs, they may serve as subject or
object of the clause and be followed by case markers. The NP modifying function of
adnominal clauses is parallel to uninflected adjectives, which were able to directly
modify NP in OJ.30 As we saw in Sect. 2.1,
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">Miyagawa (1989)</xref>
          also analyzes OJ and MJ
adnominal clauses as [nominal].
        </p>
        <p>
          Of the remaining three clause types that we have labeled nominalized, two are held
to be diachronically derived from the adnominal. Nominal complements in –aku are
derived by
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">Ohno (1953)</xref>
          from the adnominal form of the verb plus a noun *aku, e.g.,
yuk-u ‘go-Adn’ þ aku &gt; yukaku ‘going;’ kuru ‘come-Adn’ þ aku &gt; kuraku
‘coming.’31 Whitman (2004) derives the irrealis endings (-e for quadrigrade, -ure for
other conjugations) from the proto-Japanese form of the adnominal ending *-or.
        </p>
        <p>
          The irrealis (mizenkei) base in OJ is shown by Ohno to be of heterogeneous
origin. It results from reanalysis of the initial vowel in various auxiliaries and
suffixes as the ending of the irrealis (mizenkei) base. In the case of the irrealis
conditional, the ending was *-a, probably related to the nominalizing suffix *-a
hypothesized by
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">Sakakura (1966</xref>
          , pp. 286–303). This ending is preserved in such
noun-verb pairs as tuk- ‘build up’ : tuka ‘mound;’ mur(e)- ‘gather’ : mura ‘group,
village.’ The irrealis conditional appears productively only before the conditional
particle –ba, which Ohno derives from locative ni + topic marker pa. If Ohno’s
analysis is correct, it confirms the original nominalizing function of *-a as we expect
locative ni to select a [nominal] form.
30 It is widely held that inflected adjectives are a relatively late innovation in pre-OJ
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">(Omodaka et al.
1967, p. 4)</xref>
          . It is easy to find OJ examples of uninflected adjectives directly modifying the noun, e.g.,
kanasi imwo ‘dear beloved girl.’
31 Ohno’s analysis is generally accepted, but its weak point is that there is no attested noun of the form
*aku. An alternative preserving the core of Ohno’s insight would derive aku from the existential verb
root a- ‘exist’ plus the adjectival continuative –ku. It has long been pointed out that derivatives of
apartake in ‘‘stative’’-type inflections, e.g., conclusive –i in ar-i ‘exists.’ Nominals in –(a)ku would then
derive from V-ADNOM + exist-CONT, ‘being V.’
        </p>
        <p>Summing up, the four clause types that show active-ergative alignment in OJ all
derive from nominalizations: the adnominal, nominal, and realis conditional from
the pJ nominalizing suffix *-or, and the irrealis conditional from a nominalizing
suffix *-a.</p>

      <title>6.2 Nominalizations as sources for alignment</title>
      <p>
        A number of linguists have proposed nominalization structures as the diachronic
source for non-accusative alignment, particularly for languages that show
syncretism of agent and genitive marking. Proposals of this sort are made for Mayan
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">(Bricker 1981)</xref>
        , Austronesian
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">(Starosta et al. 1982; Kaufman 2007)</xref>
        , and Cariban
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18 ref19">(Gildea 1998, 2000)</xref>
        .
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">Johns (1992)</xref>
        develops a synchronic account of Inuktitut
ergativity based on nominalization.32 The starting point for these ‘nominalist’
accounts of non-accusative alignment is similar to Miyagawa’s synchronic treatment
of adnominal clauses in OJ: nominalized clauses are unable to assign structural
accusative case. Depending on the features of T, or whether T is present,
nominalized clauses may also be unable to assign structural nominative. The
nonaccusative alignment properties of nominalizations can be seen in familiar
examples, such as English derived nominalizations. Thus in the city’s destruction by the
barbarians, the nominal projection assigns neither accusative nor nominative case;
the external argument is licensed by the preposition by, and the internal argument is
assigned genitive case by D.
      </p>
      <p>
        From a diachronic perspective, the nominalist hypothesis holds that
non-accusative alignment results when nominalized clauses are reanalyzed as main clauses.
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">Gildea (1998)</xref>
        discusses a particularly rich range of alignment and word order
patterns resulting from reanalyzed nominalizations in Cariban. We focus here on
what Gildea (1998, pp. 190–196, 2000, pp. 85–88), citing
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">Franchetto (1990)</xref>
        , calls
the ‘De-ergative’ system in the Cariban languages Panare and Kuiku´ ro. The source
for this system in earlier Cariban, according to Gildea, was an object nominalization
selected by the matrix copula. In this source structure, the agent remained within the
nominalized VP while the notional object argument of the nominalized verb
corresponded to the subject of the matrix copula. Let us first look at a modern Panare
example of the de-ergative pattern (50).33
yu-noh pi ni-a’kama-piti-hpe¨ me¨n
1-grandmother dead Agt.Foc-tell-Iter-Pst it
‘My late grandmother told it over and over.’
(Gildea (2000, p. 86))
(51) shows the source structure that Gildea (2000: p. 88) posits for the de-ergative
pattern:
32 See
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">Manning (1996)</xref>
        for the global hypothesis that certain types of ergativity, in the broad sense, have
their diachronic origins in nominalizations. We are grateful to Dan Kaufman for pointing us in the
direction of this and other research in the ‘nominalist’ tradition of studies on ergativity, including his own.
33 We provide only the segmented morphophonemic representation of Gildea’s Panare data in (50) for
clarity of presentation.

        <p>The reconstructed source for a sentence like (50), for example, would involve an
object nominalization with the meaning ‘what my grandmother told over and over
again.’ ‘It’ is predicated of this nominalization by the matrix copula. The complete
reconstructed source for (50) would thus have the form ‘It is [what my grandmother
told over and over again].’ In Panare, this source structure is reanalyzed as
monoclausal, as shown in (51): the copula is reanalyzed as an auxiliary, the
nominalization as a verbal projection containing the verb and the external argument (A)
in its base position, and the original subject as the object (O). Gildea (2000, p. 98)
cites constituency tests showing that O in the Panare de-ergative construction is
external to the minimal projection containing A and the verb.</p>
        <p>Gildea’s account shows how reanalysis of a nominalization structure can result
not just in non-accusative alignment but also in a cross-linguistically marked
structure. The basic property of this structure is exactly the same as the property of
wo-marked clauses in OJ identified by Yanagida (2006) and discussed in Sect. 5.2:
the object surfaces ouside the minimal projection containing the external argument
and the verb.</p>
        <p>Japanese is not a member of a clearly defined language family of great time depth
like Cariban, so in reconstructing earlier Japanese syntax we are confined to the
technique of internal reconstruction. However we would like to conclude this
section by suggesting the possibility that a reanalysis similar to (51) was the diachronic
source of the O-wo S-gen V pattern in OJ. The etymological source of the object
marker wo has long been debated, but one fact that has not been observed is that the
shape of this particle is identical to the existential verb root wo-, which appears in
the OJ verbs wor- ‘exist, sit’ and wi- ‘be at, sit.’34 We suggest that that wo
originates as the copular verb in a construction parallel to the Cariban de-ergative
pattern.
34 Some linguists, such as Tokieda (1954), relate wo to the OJ sentence-final particle wo, which is
claimed to be emphatic; Tokieda thus claims that the original function of object marking wo was
emphatic. Whatever is meant by emphatic in this context, it cannot mean, for example, focus, since wo
marked objects in OJ are typically definite and presupposed.</p>

In (52), as in (51), a source structure involving copula+nominalization is reanalyzed
as monoclausal. The projection containing the original copula is reanalyzed as AspP,
similar to the reanalysis of the copula as an auxiliary in Cariban. The rest of the
structure remains the same. The most controversial aspect of (52) is likely to be the
hypothesis that earlier Japanese may have had a right-branching copula. But even at
the OJ stage, Japanese gives evidence for right-branching functional projections, such
as the aspectual auxiliary ari ‘be’, the modal auxiliary e ‘be able’, and the negative
imperative na, all of which appear to the left of the lexical verb (Whitman 2005).</p>
        <p>In this section we have presented typological evidence suggesting that both the
alignment and transitive constituent structure properties of OJ nominalized clauses
fit into a larger cross-linguistic pattern. Nominalized clauses may provide the
diachronic source for non-accusative alignment and for a synchronic pattern where the
object appears outside the minimal projection containing the subject and the verb.</p>
      </sec>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-19">
      <title>6.3 After OJ: the reanalysis of no as nominative</title>
      <p>As we have seen, in OJ the subject can be marked by ga or no, but their distribution is
quite different. Ga marks the external argument of transitive/unergative verbs but not
the internal argument of an unaccusative. No, on the other hand, patterns like a
nominative case marker in that it can mark both the external argument of a transitives
and the internal argument of intransitives, as we saw in Sect. 4.1:
a. 弥騰里兒能 知許布我其登久
midorigwo no ti kop-u ga gotoku
infant Gen breast desire-Adn Agt like
‘like a child desires its mother’s milk’
b. 真木乃立 荒山中尓
makwi no tatu ara yama naka
tree Gen stand rough mountain inside
‘in the rough mountains covered with trees’
(MY18/4122)
(MY 3/241)
In (53a) no marks the subject of the transitive, and in (53b) it marks the subject
of the unaccusative. The two particles ga and no behave differently at the
syntactic level as well. Yanagida (2006) shows that when the subject and object
are case-marked, the object always precedes the subject, as we saw in Sect. 4.2.
But there are a few cases of no-marked subjects which violate this
generalization. These are illustrated in (54). (Other Man’yoˆ shuˆ examples are 196, 2772,
2831, 3689.)</p>

In (54) no appears in a position preceding wo. Although this configuration is rare in
the Man’yoˆ shuˆ , it becomes widespread in kunten glosses written early in EMJ. The
following examples are taken from the Konkoˆ myoˆ Saishoˆ Oˆ kyoˆ ‘The Sutra of
Golden Light’ (kunten text ca. 830; interpretations are based on Kasuga 1969).

‘(that) good men and good women might master the Triya¯na doctrine’
Another significant development revealed in this early EMJ text is that subject
marking ga is used only in the form of aga ‘I.Subj’ and naga ‘you.Subj’; nominal
subjects are never marked by ga.35 In the Man’yoˆ shuˆ the pronominal subjects aga
35 There is one counter-example in the Konkoˆmyoˆ Saishoˆ Oˆkyoˆ where a nonpronominal subject takes ga
and the object takes wo, in (i).

can occur in sentence initial position, preceding a wo-marked object, as shown in
(56).

It appears from this data that ga as an active case marker, in the formal sense we have
defined in this paper, was lost early in the EMJ period. The limitation of ga to first and
second person pronouns was probably a step on the way in this process. (Recall that in
many languages, active case is restricted to first and second personal pronouns.)</p>
      <p>Finally, in Sect. 4.3.1 we saw evidence for a pronominal active prefix i- in OJ. In
the Konkoˆ myoˆ Saishoˆ Oˆ kyoˆ , however, there are many instances of the
postnominal particle i marking the agent arguments of transitive/unergative verbs, as
shown in (57):</p>
      <p>Ware i … ti ga sakai wo
I Nom wisdom Ga border Acc
‘I passed through the border of wisdom.’

(K 8-19:155)
As we saw in Sect. 2.3.1, Vovin (1997) analyzes the postnominal particle i in OJ as
an active (agentive) marker. However, considering the fact that early kunten texts
were heavily influenced by Korean glossing for Chinese Buddhist texts, it is
possible that subject marking i is a borrowing of the Korean nominative marker i. This
would be consistent with the view of Vovin (2005) that the much rarer subject
marker i found in OJ is a Korean loan. In any case, EMJ i patterns like no, rather
than OJ ga, in that it appears in a position preceding wo.</p>
      <p>The word order facts suggest that Japanese was well on the way to developing
accusative alignment even in nominalized clauses by the early EMJ period.
Transitive subjects, regardless of the phonetic form of their case marker, were assigned
case in a position higher than wo-marked objects. This case was spelled out as ga

The eventual reanalysis of ga as a nominative particle in Tokyo and Kansai Japanese is a topic that far
exceeds the scope of this paper. Yamada (2000) examines the increase in the frequency of ga by
comparing the original text of the Tale of Heike, which is believed to reflect the language of the
fourteenth century, with the Jesuit romanized text of Heike, known as the Amakusa Heike, published in
1592. He observes that many of the unmarked subjects in the Tale of Heike came to be marked by ga in
Amakusa Heike. This may indicate that ga reappeared as a nominative case in the late 16th century. The
matter is confounded by the association of ga and no with pejorative and honorific functions, as reported
by Jesuit grammarians in the early seventeenth century. Interestingly, according Yamada’s observation,
ga in this period is used on the subjects of unaccusative verbs and adjectives but rarely on the subjects of
a transitive/unergative verb. This contrasts directly with the distribution of ga in the Man’yoˆ sh uˆ.</p>

        <title>7 Conclusion</title>
        <p>(on first and second person pronouns), i (on some agentive subjects), or no (the
elsewhere case).
In this paper, we have proposed that Japanese at its oldest attested stage, the central
dialect OJ of the eighth century, shows evidence of active alignment. OJ displays a
split in case marking beween main (conclusive) and nominalized clauses. Main
conclusive clauses are accusative. Nominalized clauses display active alignment in
case marking and cross-referencing of arguments on the verb through prefixation.
The distinctive O wo S V pattern of transitive nominalized clauses identified by
Yanagida (2006) is consistent with a formal analysis of active alignment where the
external argument receives inherent active case in situ. Cross-linguistic comparison
shows that nominalization is a widespread source for non-accusative alignment, as
well as for a pattern where the surface position of the object is higher than the
subject.</p>

        <title>Appendix 1: Bare objects in relative clauses</title>
        <p>The possible counter-examples to Miyagawa’s generalization in (5) are given
below. Phrasal objects can appear with adnominal relative clause predicates when
they occur in main clause initial position, as shown in (58).
(58) a. [Tomo-no Ura-no iso-no murwo-no kwi-Ø]</p>
        <p>Tomo Bay Gen beach Gen cypress Gen tree
[[pro mimu-goto-ni api-misi] imo]pa wasura-ye-me yamo (MY 3/447)
see wheneversee maid-TOP forget-AUX Q
‘Whenever I see the cypress-tree by the beach beside Tomo Bay, would</p>
        <p>I ever forget my dear who stood by me and saw it?’
b. [Kadusika no Mama no iriyeni utinabiku tamamo-Ø]</p>
        <p>Kazushika Gen Mama Gen inlet in wave seaweed
[[pro kari-kyemu]tekwona] si omopo-yu (MY 3/433)
cut-AUX maid FOC remembee-AUX
‘I remember the maid who gathered the waving seaweed in the inlet
of Mama of the Kazushika region.’
The phrasal objects in clause-initial position in (58) are left dislocated to the left
peripheral topic position. A left dislocated topic may serve as what is known as
jokotoba ‘introductory stanza’, an important rhetorical device used throughout the
Man’yoˆ shuˆ . The introductory stanza prefaces the contents of the succeeding verse.
Note that a bare oblique NP can also be left dislocated out of a relative clause with
an intransitive predicate, as in (59).
(59) [Yupuyami-no konopa Ø] [[pro komoreru] tukwi] matu gotosi.
evening-dark Gen tree-leave hide moon wait like
(MY 11/2666)
‘I feel as if I were waiting for the moon hidden behind an evening tree.’
In OJ, not only the object of a transitive verb but also the locative adjunct of an
intransitive verb can be morphologically bare. The bare NP in (59) is not a
counterexample to Miyagawa’s generalization on two counts: first, it is an adjunct and thus
is not assigned structural case; second, it occurs in main clause initial position and
thus may be interpreted as left dislocated.</p>
        <p>In other cases of bare NP adjuncts we know that the first explanation is at work.
The two bare NP adjuncts ama no sita ‘the land’ (lit. ‘under the heavens’) and
tamapoko-no miti ‘road’ can appear inside an adnominal clause: there are four
occurrences of ama-no-sita and six of tamapoko-no miti, as illustrated in (60).
(For other examples, see MY 162, 207, 230, 1738, 3276, 4006, 4098, 4465.)

(MY 2/207)
Ama no sita ‘land’ and tamapoko-no miti ‘road’ are analyzable as compound
nouns and thus are probably not true counter-examples. The word tamapoko
belongs to the category of so-called makura kotoba ‘pillow words’ or epithets, which
are fixed designators of the referent that follows them. They are conventionalized
and often unintelligible. There are two genuine count-erexamples, listed below.

‘At a young age, I was like a child wearing clothes with sleeves</p>
        <p>printed in colors.’
Appendix 2: Wo in imperative and conclusive clauses
Eight hundred three instances of wo-marked objects in the Man’yoˆ shuˆ are listed in
Koji (1988). (These do not include wo-mi constructions, wo used for
makurakotoba epithets, and occurrences with other particles such as wo-ba.)36 Most of the
803 tokens appear in nominalized clauses, as expected; that is, the predicates in the
irrealis (mizenkei) conditionals, continuative (renyoˆ kei), adnominal (rentaikei),
realis (izenkei), and –aku nominal clauses. There are, however, some exceptions:
Six instances of wo-marked objects appear with the predicate in the imperative form
(62), and 34 appear with the conclusive predicate in main and purposive clauses
marked by to (63–64).
(62) Imperative: (6 tokens)</p>
        <p>Aki no yupupye wa ware wo sinopas-e.
autumn Gen evening Top me Obj remember-Imp
‘(On) autumn evenings, remember me.’
(MY 20/4444)
Main clause conclusive: (23 tokens)
a. Putari site musubisi pimo wo pitori site are pa
together tied cord Obj alone I Top
toki mi-zi. (MY 12/2919)
untie try-Neg.Conj.Conc
‘The sash cords that we tied together, I will surely not untie alone.’
b. Ware-wo wasuras-u na. (MY 14/3457)
me-Obj forget-Conc Neg.Imp
‘Don’t forget me.’</p>
      </sec>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-20">
      <title>Conclusive in to-marked clauses: (11 tokens) tama wo pirop-u to jewel Obj find-Conc Comp ‘in order to find the jewel’</title>
      <p>(MY 7/1220)
There are 119 additional instances of wo-marked objects that precede to-marked
clauses, but they may be taken as arguments of ellipted higher verbs such as omopu
‘think’ or ipu ‘say’. In these examples, wo-marked objects are arguments of
nonconclusive, non-imperative clauses, as illustrated in (65).</p>
      <p>Kimi woi [proi sakiku are to] (omopite)
lord Obj safe be Comp (thinking)
ipapibe sue-t-u.
offering vessel place-Perf-Conc
‘(Thinking) of my lord, ‘May he be safe,’ I placed the offering vessel.’
(MY 17/3927)
36 According to Koji (1988), there are a total of 1,557 instances of object marking wo in the Manyoˆshuˆ.
As discussed in Sect. 5.2, we assume that OJ has no ECM constructions; the
womarked subject of the inactive verb is in fact the argument of the higher verb omopu
‘think’, which has been deleted in (3927) but standardly interpreted as underlyingly
present in this and similar examples. There are also in Koji (1988) at least three
examples of wo-marked objects that precede to-marked clauses; these however
should be taken as dislocated topics (MY 2/148, MY 10/2228, MY 20/4300). They
are not arguments of embedded to-marked clauses but serve as jokotoba
‘introductory stanzas’, as discussed above. There are also four occurrences of wo-marked
objects embedded in –rasi clauses, as in (66) (MY 13, 3145, 4111, 4427).</p>
      <p>Wagimoko si a wo sinop-u
my.girl Emph me Obj think-Conc
‘My girl seems to be thinking of me.’
ras-i.
seem-Conc
(MY 12/3145)
These data show that wo-marking had spread beyond nominalized clauses in the OJ
period, but its distribution appears quite restricted. Most instances of wo-marking
with conclusive predicates involve ‘that’ clauses such as (64–65), and many of the
conclusive main clause examples such as (64a) involve topicalized objects. This
suggests a scenario for the spread of wo marking to conclusive clauses. Topicalized
wo-marked objects with propositional attitude verbs selecting a to-clause
complement may have been reanalyzed as extracted directly from the to-clause, especially
in contexts like (65), where the higher verb is dropped.</p>
      <p>Support for this scenario comes from the rarity of wo-marking in imperatives.
Koji (1988) cites only six examples. Four of these (MY 4009, 4444, 4177, and 4179)
are from songs in volumes 17–19 of the Man’yoˆ shuˆ , composed by Ootomo no
Yakamochi or his associates in the period around 750. Of the remaining two
examples, MY 3764 was composed around the same period by Nakatomo no
Yakamori while wo in MY 2352 is analyzable as a vocative particle. This suggests
that wo-marking in imperatives was a relatively late innovation. It may have arisen
by analogy with wo- marking in infinitive clauses, triggered by a phonological
merger. Four of the five clear examples cited above involve imperative predicates
with root final –s; imperative –ye and lower bigrade infinitive –e had merged after
/s/ well before the eighth century.</p>
